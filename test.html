<p>[Father, please put your brain here!]</p> <p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p> <p>Lin&#8217;an Prefecture, Yuhang County.</p> <p>On the main road, a luxurious carriage sped by, kicking up a cloud of dust. A young man dressed in coarse clothing used his sleeve to cover his nose and mouth, coughing a few times.</p> <p>&#8220;Cough, cough&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Fanning away the dust with his sleeve, he muttered, &#8220;Ancient people, really low class&#8230;"</p> <p>Chen Ye lowered his sleeve and glanced at the grey-blue city wall in the distance, feeling a sense of relief. Finally, he was almost there.</p> <p>Two days ago, Chen Ye had transmigrated to this parallel world called the Great Wu Dynasty. This world did not belong to any historical dynasty Chen Ye knew of.</p> <p>Just as his eyes darkened, he activated the standard equipment of a transmigrator &#8212;-- the system. However, Chen Ye&#8217;s system was somewhat special. It was called the &#12304;Orphan Cultivation System&#12305;</p> <p>As the name implied, the main function of this system was to cultivate orphans.</p> <p>After Chen Ye adopted orphans, he could earn points through various education activities. These points could be used to draw skills, upgrade the orphanage, and exchange for supplies.</p> <p>Once he successfully cultivated an orphan to the point where they could survive on their own, the system would reward him with a large amount of money, bonuses to extend lifespan, and special opportunities to draw &#12304;Director skills&#12305;.</p> <p>After acquiring the system, it restored Chen Ye&#8217;s body to that of a 20-year-old, gave him the identity of an ordinary commoner, and even gifted him an &#8220;Infant Care Centre (Orphanage)&#8221; along with the opportunity of a one time &#12304;Director skill&#12305; draw.</p> <p>At first, Chen Ye didn&#8217;t think much of it, but when he drew his skill, he was stunned.</p> <p>&#12304;Indestructible Body : Nothing in this world can harm your body&#12305;</p> <p>After rubbing his eyes, Chen Ye realised it was real. This skill meant that neither weapons nor poison could harm him.</p> <p>He was practically invincible.</p> <p>Of course, he could still drown, suffocate, or die from appendicitis, but even so, it was incredibly impressive.</p> <p>Over the past two days, Chen Ye had gained some understanding of this world. The Great Wu Dynasty was not as peaceful as it seemed; the borders were still entangled in war.</p> <p>On the road, he frequently saw armed warriors with cold eyes and a murderous aura. With this skill, Chen Ye at least didn&#8217;t have to worry about being hacked to death. After all, ancient times were pretty chaotic.</p> <p>&#8220;I wonder if this world has sects and martial art masters.&#8221; Chen Ye thought as he walked, his heart filled with longing.</p> <p>As a man, who hasn&#8217;t dreamt of wandering the world with a sword like a martial hero?</p> <p>Due to limited information channels, in the past two days, Chen Ye had only seen armed escorts and passing warriors, but none of the white-clad swordsmen on large horses from wuxia novels.</p> <p>After resting briefly by the roadside, Chen Ye joined the crowd of labourers heading towards the gates of Yuhang County.</p> <p>Tall, grey-blue city walls loomed ahead, with soldiers holding bows standing atop, their cold eyes inspecting the people entering the city.</p> <p>The guards checked Chen Ye briefly before waving him through. He entered Yuhang County, under the jurisdiction of Lin&#8217;an Prefecture..</p> <p>&#8220;System, how much further?&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye summoned the system interface in his mind. A blue, translucent screen appeared before his eyes.</p> <p>&#12304;Orphan Cultivation System 1.0&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Note: The system will upgrade once the orphanage reaches a certain scale&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Host: Chen Ye&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 20&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Points: 0&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Director Skills: Indestructible body&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Indestructible Body: Nothing in this world can harm your body&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Task: Reach Yuhang Orphanage (location guidance in progress&#8230;)&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Task Reward: Newbie Gift Pack&#12305;</p> <p>Two days ago, Chen Ye transmigrated here. Although the system had gifted him an orphanage, it was located in Yuhang County.</p> <p>It had taken him a full two days to reach Yuhang County.</p> <p>Looking at the system&#8217;s map, he saw that the location wasn&#8217;t far. Chen Ye breathed a sigh of relief and began to survey his surroundings.</p> <p>Yuhang County, under the jurisdiction of Lin&#8217;an Prefecture, was inland and seemed quite peaceful. The streets were bustling with people.</p> <p>There was a steamer on a small cart on the street and hot white steam rose from it. Chen Ye caught a whiff of the delicious smell and pulled out four copper coins, buying two buns.</p> <p>When the system gave him his identity, it also provided 100 copper coins.</p> <p>2 copper coins in Great Wu, had the purchasing power equivalent to 1 yuan in his previous world. After two days of travel, there were not many coins left to spend.</p> <p>After devouring one bun hungrily,his hunger was somewhat alleviated. Just as he was about to eat the second one, a foul stench wafted over.</p> <p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s face changed drastically, suddenly the bun in his mouth didn&#8217;t taste as good anymore. He turned to see a little boy with dirty clothes, unkempt hair and a runny nose staring longingly at the bun in Chen Ye&#8217;s hand.</p> <p>The boy sniffled as he watched.</p> <p>Chen Ye took a few steps back; the boy&#8217;s clothes were filthy, and even from a distance, the stench was overpowering. Passersby covered their noses and hurried past, unwilling to linger.</p> <p>The little boy sniffled, his eyes dull and hollow.</p> <p>Chen Ye took one look and knew he was a beggar, maybe even homeless. In terms of age, he looked probably around ten years old.</p> <p>Over the past two days, Chen Ye had seen many beggars.</p> <p>There were numerous wanderers and beggars in ancient times, almost everywhere. After witnessing this, Che Ye finally understood why the Beggar Sect was the largest sect in the world, there were simply too many people.</p> <p>Thinking about this, Chen Ye had an idea. This kid was probably an orphan. Should he take him to his orphanage?</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s eyes lit up at the thought, but then he met the boy&#8217;s gaze. His gaze was so dull and dumb.</p> <p>Chen Ye quickly calmed down. He rubbed his chin. How could he cultivate such a dimwit to have survival skills? Forget it, it would be too difficult.</p> <p>During his two day journey, Chen Ye had already made his plan.</p> <p>Recruit a few clever orphans, cultivate them for a while, and once the system issued rewards, he could just take the money and live a life of leisure. After that, he could enjoy a life of multiple wives and concubines, surrounded by beauties. Wouldn&#8217;t that be wonderful?</p> <p>He could hire a few people to manage the orphanage and exploit the system for all it was worth. Thinking of this, Chen Ye shook his head and turned to leave. One must be smart in life and not do foolish things.</p> <p>This was advice Chen Ye&#8217;s father had left him on his deathbed.</p> <p>Holding the bun, Chen Ye intended to wait until the stench had dispersed before eating it. After a few steps, he sniffed the air and paused. Turned around and saw the little beggar was still following him.</p> <p>The little beggar stared longingly at the bun in Chen Ye&#8217;s hand, sniffling nonstop. Seeing this, Chen Ye was about to put on a stern face to scare him away.</p> <p>But then he noticed faint bruises on the boy&#8217;s face, limping while he walked, and knew the boy must have been beaten quite a bit.</p> <p>During these past two days, Chen Ye had seen many beggars, and his heart had been moved. But one as young as this boy, it was his first time seeing.</p> <p>As a modern person with a normal conscience, he couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little uncomfortable. In his previous life, a child this age should have been in primary school.</p> <p>Chen Ye thought for a moment, sighed, and walked over, placing the bun in the boy&#8217;s hand.</p> <p>&#8220;Here you go. Don&#8217;t follow me anymore.&#8221;</p> <p>With that, Chen Ye turned and left; meeting by chance, just consider it a good deed.</p> <p>Following the system&#8217;s guidance, he headed towards Yuhang Orphanage. He wondered how big the orphanage was, how many orphans it had, and how much deposit it had.</p> <p>Chen Ye fantasised as he walked along the stone-paved road, lined with shops and stalls selling all kinds of food and goods.</p> <p>He looked at the place indicated by the system. It was less than a hundred metres away from the orphanage. It looked like it was located at the corner of the street. The location was a bit remote, but that didn&#8217;t matter.</p> <p>As he was thinking, a faint scent of perfume wafted into Chen Ye&#8217;s nose.</p> <p>&#8220;Come have some fun, dear&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Sir, I&#8217;ve missed you&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>A few coquettish voices came from ahead.</p> <p>Chen Ye stopped, eyes widening slightly with surprise and uncertainty as he stared at the sign reading &#8220;Yihong Brothel&#8221;.</p> <p>He saw several well-dressed men with wobbly legs exiting the brothel, their faces flushed with happiness, clearly reluctant to leave.</p> <p>On the second floor, a woman in green noticed Chen Ye and threw him a flirtatious gaze. Chen Ye took a deep breath. Given Yuhang County&#8217;s prosperity, having brothels was normal.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p> <p>As he was pondering, an innocent voice called out beside him.</p> <p>Huh? Whose kid is it, calling people dad so randomly?</p> <p>Chen Ye was about to greet the lady upstairs when he smelled the familiar stench.</p> <p>He turned slightly and found the source.The snot-nosed little beggar had followed him again, now staring at Chen Ye with wide eyes.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye look at him, the little beggar called out again, &#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Chen Ye&#8217;s face changed.</p> <p>The woman who had been throwing him flirtatious glances also turned away, uninterested, and started trying to attract other customers.</p> <p>&#8221;Don&#8217;t call me that, or I&#8217;ll smack you.&#8221; Chen Ye&#8217;s face darkened.</p> <p>Why was this kid still clinging to me?</p> <p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221; The little beggar sniffled and repeated.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s head ached. Ignoring the boy, he quickened his pace towards the orphanage.</p> <p>After running several dozen metres, he heard the cold mechanical voice of the system in his ear.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations to the host for reaching &#8220;Yuhang Orphanage.&#8221;&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You&#8217;ve received a newbie gift pack!&#12305;</p> <p>Chen Ye stopped and stared at the 60-70 square metres-sized small courtyard in front of him, then he looked at Yihong Brothel, which was no more than a hundred metres away.</p> <p>A sign hanging at the entrance of the small courtyard read &#8220;Yuhang Orphanage.&#8221;</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye was stunned for a moment, then looked at the small courtyard made with green tiles, white walls and curved eaves.However, he couldn&#8217;t believe his eyes.</p> <p>Was this the orphanage the system had given him? Wasn&#8217;t it a bit small?</p> <p>But the bigger issue was, who places an orphanage less than a hundred meters from a brothel?</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered for a moment, his expression becoming strange as he came to a realization.</p> <p>Thinking about it, It made sense.</p> <p>If those ladies accidentally had children, wouldn&#8217;t they send them to the orphanage?</p> <p>Chen Ye felt a pang of frustration.</p> <p>He stepped through the gate of &#8220;Yuhang Orphanage&#8221; and saw an eighty square meter courtyard.</p> <p>Apart from the courtyard, there were three small rooms, each roughly a hundred square meters. The courtyard was spotless, and the wooden doors of the rooms were brand new, emitting a faint wood fragrance.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked into one of the rooms and glanced around. The furniture and furnishing were all in place. Apart from the lack of orphans, the place was actually quite decent.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;New Task: Adoption&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Task Information: Please adopt an orphan within three days.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Task Reward: 100 points, 20 taels of silver.&#12305;</p> <p>The courtyard was different from what Chen Ye had imagined, but it was acceptable.</p> <p>&#8216;Let&#8217;s open the newbie gift pack first.&#8217;</p> <p>Thinking this, Chen Ye mentally commanded &#8220;Open the newbie gift pack!&#8221;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Newbie Gift Pack opened successfully!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations host, you have received: 20 taels of silver, Orphan Skills &#8220;Strong Physique&#8221; and &#8220;Skillful Hands.&#8221;&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Strong Physique: Strength growth accelerated; can only wield heavy weapons.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Dexterous Hands: Enhanced talent for daily life skills like cooking and mending; greatly improved talent for mechanics and handiwork.&#12305;</p> <p>After opening the newbie gift pack, a smile spread across Chen Ye&#8217;s face.</p> <p>Twenty taels of silver were equivalent to 20,000 copper coins, or about 10,000 yuan in modern terms.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze fell on the two skills.</p> <p>&#12304;Strong Physique&#12305; and &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305;. Why did these skills seem a bit strange?</p> <p>The first half was fine, but what&#8217;s wrong with the second half?</p> <p>&#8216;Can only wield heavy weapons; greatly enhanced mechanical and handiwork skills.&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered for a moment but didn&#8217;t dwell on it.</p> <p>It seemed simple to him, as he only needed to recruit a few orphans, give them the skills, teach them some basic survival skills, and that was it. He would just wait for the system to issue rewards. No need to overthink it.</p> <p>Moving on from that thought, Chen Ye fell into contemplation again.</p> <p>He needed to adopt an orphan within three days, and they had to be smart and clever. That wouldn&#8217;t be easy.</p> <p>Generally, the smart and clever orphans had long been sold into servitude as house servants or maids.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221; An innocent voice suddenly interrupted Chen Ye&#8217;s thoughts.</p> <p>&#8220;Tch, why did you follow me here too?!&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye was startled to see the snot-nosed little beggar had somehow followed him inside, staring at him dumbly.</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the boy for a while. The boy&#8217;s eyes shifted slightly but still looked foolish.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Sniff&#8230;&#8221; The little beggar repeated.</p> <p>&#8220;What kind of situation is this&#8230;&#8221; Chen Ye looked at the little beggar and muttered.</p> <p>This kid had followed me all the way here, calling me dad so affectionately.</p> <p>Even though he didn&#8217;t meet Chen Ye&#8217;s criteria for adoption, smart and clever, there weren&#8217;t any other orphans around.</p> <p>Hmm, if he&#8217;s begging on the streets, then he&#8217;s probably an orphan right?</p> <p>For the sake of the system reward, let&#8217;s take him in. Chen Ye made his decision.</p> <p>&#8220;Fine, fine&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t call me dad. I&#8217;m not much older than you. Call me Director.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s face darkened, but his gaze toward the little beggar softened.</p> <p>The little beggar stared dumbly at Chen Ye and called out again, &#8220;Dad.&#8221;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations host, for completing the adoption!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Rewards issued: 100 points, 20 taels of silver.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Please name the orphan: - - - -&#12305;</p> <p>Huh? There&#8217;s a naming part too?</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the snot-nosed little beggar. The boy gazed back at him with a dumb look in his eyes.</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly felt a headache, "From now on, your name will be Chen Da Ming! Hopefully, you'll grow up to be a bit smarter."</p> <p>This name carried Chen Ye's hopeful wishes.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations host, for successfully naming!&#12305;</p> <p>With the name Chen Da Ming, the boy's eyes moved slightly, and he said again, "Dad, I'm hungry!"</p> <p>"Stop fussing, your dad here is hungry too."</p> <p>"Actually, no. Call me Director. I'm not your dad." Chen Ye's face was as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p> <p>Guo Jing, that silly man picked up a little beggar, but turned into a beautiful girl.</p> <p>They are both beggars, but why is it that when I pick up a beggar, it's a dumb kid?</p> <p>After naming Chen Da Ming, the system popped up an information panel.</p> <p>&#12304;Name: Chen Da Ming&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;ID: 0001&#12305; {ED: Has a bit of a Hitman vibe to it, doesn&#8217;t it? Then again, the story is just that}</p> <p>&#12304;Gender: Male&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 10 years old&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Skills: None&#12305;</p> <p>Skills...</p> <p>Right, I can assign skills to orphans.</p> <p>With a thought, two skill options appeared before Chen Ye's eyes.</p> <p>&#12304;Strong Physique&#12305; and &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305;.</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the two skill options and without hesitation, assigned &#12304;Strong Physique&#12305; to Chen Da Ming.</p> <p>Are you kidding? Giving this silly kid &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305;?</p> <p>"Da Ming, I don't ask for much. Just grow up strong and help me with some work in the future."</p> <p>Chen Ye said earnestly while squatting down in front of Da Ming.</p> <p>"Dad, I'm hungry." Chen Da Ming sniffled, and shouted with a serious look on his face.</p> <p>Chen Ye could only hope Chen Da Ming&#8217;s condition would improve over time.</p> <p>After taking in Chen Da Ming, Chen Ye walked through the three rooms of the orphanage, and took a look around.</p> <p>There were tables, chairs, and beddings, but no daily necessities or food supplies.</p> <p>Chen Ye still needed to buy it himself.</p> <p>&#8220;Forget it, 40 taels of silver, it shouldn&#8217;t cost much to buy those.&#8221; Chen Ye muttered.</p> <p>Back to the courtyard, smelling the stench coming from Chen Da Ming. Chen Ye covered his nose:</p> <p>&#8220;Come on, Da Ming, Director will take you to buy you some new clothes first."</p> <p>&#8220;Then take a bath.&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming sniffled again, staring with dumb eyes, and obediently followed behind Chen Ye.</p> <p>The two walked out of the courtyard to buy supplies.</p> <p>Since Da Ming hadn't bathed in who knows how long, nobody dared come within three meters of them on the street, drawing numerous curses from passersby.</p> <p>Chen Ye first bought him some clothes, then headed to the river outside the city to give him a bath and change his clothes.</p> <p>Once cleaned up, Chen Da Ming's true appearance emerged.</p> <p>To describe it simply, he looked plain and average, a foolish and honest look plastered on his face. Chen Ye sighed while patting Da Ming's head.</p> <p>Though he wanted to take in only smart and clever orphans, the abandoned ones were often those with disabilities or illnesses.</p> <p>Again, most bright and clever orphans had already found ways to make a living.</p> <p>Where would Chen Ye ever get such a lucky deal?</p> <p>Walking through Yuhang County with Da Ming, the air was filled with the scent of horse manure. The carriages and people moved leisurely.</p> <p>The inns and restaurants lining the street had bright signs, with the aromas of wine and food wafting out, making Chen Ye's stomach growl again.</p> <p>After buying everything, he would quickly head home to make a good meal.</p> <p>While he was thinking this, Chen Ye noticed Da Ming drooling, so he took out some coins and bought him two buns to snack on.</p> <p>Continuing along the road, the two of them arrived in front of a shop called "Zhaocai Grain Store."</p> <p>After some inquiries, Chen Ye bought 25 kilograms of rice and 25 kilograms of mixed grain flour at 8 copper coins per kilogram.</p> <p>After weighing the goods, the shop assistant lifted a bag of mixed grain flour. With a glance, he exclaimed in surprise, "Young Master Chen, this boy has quite the strength!"</p> <p>Da Ming sniffled as he lifted the 25 kilogram bag of rice onto his small frame, his steps slightly unsteady as he walked out.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't bother explaining his relationship with Da Ming.</p> <p>When he saw Da Ming carrying the bag of rice out, he was also somewhat surprised.</p> <p>Rubbing his chin, Chen Ye pondered, "Could it be that I've found a treasure? Was he born with great strength? Or is it because of the skill?"</p> <p>That bag of rice weighed about 50 pounds, and it wasn't easy for a ten-year-old child to lift it. This was enough to explain the peculiarity.</p> <p>&#8216;Well, although his brain isn't particularly sharp, he's got strength. He won't starve in the future.&#8217;</p> <p>&#8216;Yeah, maybe I can consider sending Da Ming to learn a thing or two at the blacksmith's shop in the future&#8230;&#8217;</p> <p>Taking in a child meant being responsible for them. Planning their career well and giving them specialized training. This was the only way for orphans to quickly grasp survival skills and become self-reliant</p> <p>Chen Ye picked up a few small bags of grain.</p> <p>As he exited the grain shop, he saw Da Ming standing at the entrance, panting, with the rice bag on the ground.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye come out, Da Ming called out innocently, "Dad, I'm hungry!"</p> <p>"Good grief, didn't you just eat&#8230;" Chen Ye's face darkened.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye handed a few bags of small beans to Da Ming, hoisted the sack of rice and directed the waiter towards the direction of the orphanage. Da Ming kept his head down, obediently following behind Chen Ye.</p> <p>The streets were bustling with people, and Chen Ye suddenly noticed several police officers standing by the roadside, questioning a woman. The woman, dressed in a pale yellow dress, had red, swollen eyes and was continuously sobbing and sniffing.</p> <p>"My poor child..." </p> <p>
&#8220;I just turned around for a moment, and he disappeared.&#8221;</p> <p>"Captain Song, I beg of you..."</p> <p>The woman grew increasingly agitated as she spoke, she couldn't help but kneel down in desperation. Among the officers, a burly man with a tanned face, hurriedly helped the woman to her feet.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced over and shook his head slightly.</p> <p>Even in ancient times, there were human traffickers. Abducted boys were sold as household servants, while girls were sold to brothels. It was a common occurrence, once a child was kidnapped, they were never found again.</p> <p>Thinking about this, Chen Ye quickly turned and looked at Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming noticed Chen Ye's gaze and grinned foolishly, "Father!"</p> <p>Chen Ye breathed a sigh of relief. Surely the traffickers wouldn't abduct Da Ming right?</p> <p>&#8216;Da Ming is so simple-minded, which foolish human trafficker would abduct him? I must be overthinking.&#8217;</p> <p>The waiter, carrying sacks of flour, looked at the weeping woman and sighed, "Just these past few days, we've lost another one."</p> <p>"Counting this one, nearly twenty children have gone missing in Yuhang County this month."</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Chen Ye was somewhat surprised.</p> <p>&#8220;Is it that serious?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t the police have any leads?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The police are just here for show,&#8221; the waiter scoffed.</p> <p>&#8220;When trouble arises, don&#8217;t count on them. Except for catching the folks in the village. They can&#8217;t handle anything big.&#8221;</p> <p>The tanned-faced officer comforting the woman suddenly turned his head and looked at Chen Ye and the waiter.</p> <p>The waiter, carrying the sacks of grain, didn&#8217;t notice this exchange.</p> <p>Chen Ye felt a slight surprise in his heart; the distance between the waiter and the tanned-faced officer was nearly ten meters.</p> <p>With this distance coupled with the surrounding chatter of pedestrians, could the dark-faced constable hear what the innkeeper was saying?</p> <p>As he pondered, Chen Ye couldn't help but take another glance at the tanned-faced officer.</p> <p>The tanned-faced officer seemed to have casually glanced over before quickly turning his head away.</p> <p>Was it just a coincidence?</p> <p>Or are there really martial arts masters in this world?</p> <p>A trace of doubt arose in Chen Ye's mind.</p> <p>He continued along the stone-paved street, moving forward and soon arrived in front of Yi Hong Brothel.</p> <p>From upstairs came the coquettish laughter of women, their captivating faces peeking out as they waved handkerchiefs and half-covered their faces with round fans. Their eyes sparkled as they occasionally cast flirtatious glances at the passersby.</p> <p>The air was filled with a faint scent of perfume.</p> <p>The waiter paused to watch, his face filled of envy.</p> <p>"If only I could go in and experience it just once,it would be worth it."</p> <p>Hearing the waiter&#8217;s words, Chen Ye couldn't help but chuckle, "Why? Brother Zhang, is the cost of Yi Hong Brothel very expensive?"</p> <p>The waiter, surnamed Zhang, had learned each other's names during their conversation along the way.</p> <p>"Ten taels of silver for one night."</p> <p>The waiter looked at the lavishly dressed women upstairs, swallowing hard as he spoke.</p> <p>10 taels of silver?</p> <p>Chen Ye's expression changed slightly.</p> <p>Is that 13 taels inlaid with gold or silver?</p> <p>That's so expensive!</p> <p>Chen Ye immediately dismissed the idea he had earlier of going in to take a look around, donate, and show kindness.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming followed behind Chen Ye. Seeing the two adults stopped to watch, he also looked up at the building.</p> <p>He was still young and didn&#8217;t understand what was so interesting about it.</p> <p>"When I have money, I definitely have to experience this," the waiter said firmly.</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded non-stop: "Let's talk about it when we have money."</p> <p>Da Ming blinked and scratched his head.</p> <p>He understood this sentence.</p> <p>Let's talk about it when we have money&#8230;</p> <p>Da Ming looked up at the building and remembered it deeply.</p> <p>The waiter put down the sack of rice from his shoulder, switched shoulders, and said breathlessly, "Young Master Chen, are we almost there?"</p> <p>Chen Ye, also covered in sweat, wiped the sweat on his face and said, "It's just ahead."</p> <p>The location of the orphanage was indeed a bit remote, located on the outskirts of the city. It&#8217;s no wonder it was next to a brothel; such places couldn't be in the city center. Chen Ye and the waiter quickened their pace and soon arrived in front of the orphanage.</p> <p>The waiter put down the sack of rice and looked up at the imposing character "Orphanage" on the sign, falling into deep thought.</p> <p>He looked at the nearby Yi Hong brothel, and his expression suddenly became very peculiar. The waiter opened his mouth, showing a strange expression, but he said nothing. Chen Ye knew the man had misunderstood, but he didn't explain. He carried the rice into the courtyard.</p> <p>The waiter hurriedly picked up the sack of grains and followed him in. After storing the rice and grains in the storeroom, Chen Ye gave him a small tip and sent him on his way.</p> <p>After completing these trivial tasks, Chen Ye sat on a chair, poured two cups of water from the teapot, and handed one to Da Ming.</p> <p>"Phew..."</p> <p>Chen Ye drank the water in one gulp, then rested for a moment before taking Da Ming out again to buy groceries.</p> <p>With all the essentials procured, it was now approaching evening.</p> <p>The setting sun hung slanting over the wall, casting an orange-red glow on the ground. From each rooftop, wisps of smoke rose, and the faint aroma of cooking wafted and spread throughout Yuhang County.</p> <p>Standing at the entrance of the orphanage, Chen Ye felt the warmth of the setting sun on his face, tinged with a hint of coolness. From now on, he would truly be living in ancient times.</p> <p>After two days of hustle and bustle, coming to the orphanage provided them with a place to stay. For Chinese people, having their own house meant having a home. Chen Ye felt a bit sentimental. He looked down and patted the head of Da Ming beside him.</p> <p>A new life was about to begin. He now had a child under his care. Raising an orphan... was a daunting task.</p> <p>Da Ming felt the rough warmth of Chen Ye's large hand and looked up, staring blankly, "Dad, I'm hungry."</p> <p>This sentence instantly shattered the serene atmosphere, and Chen Ye's face turned as dark as the bottom of a pot.</p> <p>"Eat, eat and stuff yourself to death today, should be enough." Chen Ye grumbled, leading Da Ming into the courtyard and closed the gate. Before long, smoke rose from the small courtyard with the word "Yuhang Orphanage" written on it.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Time passed, and night fell.</p> <p>In the dimly lit room, Chen Ye carefully struck a flint to light an oil lamp. The flame flickered twice before casting its light, driving away the surrounding darkness.</p> <p>The big kid sat at the table, staring wide-eyed at the oil lamp.</p> <p>"Life without electric lights in ancient times is really inconvenient," Chen Ye remarked.</p> <p>As the long night stretched on, Chen Ye and the big kid sat in the small room, staring at each other in silence.</p> <p>There was a curfew in the Great Wu Dynasty at night, and idle people couldn't go out. Those gallant fellows next door could only stay overnight and couldn't go home.</p> <p>"There's nothing to do."</p> <p>Suddenly, Chen Ye remembered the System Mall. He had adopted Da Ming and received 100 points as a reward, which he could now spend. Opening the System Mall, there were four sections: Medicine, Books, Daily Necessities, and Lucky Draw.</p> <p>In the Medicine section, there were not only modern medicine capsules but also various kinds of ancient medicines and powders.</p> <p>The Books section covered a variety of books, and as Chen Ye glanced over, he noticed a bottle of plum wine and a certain kind of cushion.</p> <p>The Daily Necessities section contained all sorts of clothing, grains and oils, kitchen condiments, and even toilet paper.</p> <p>The last section, the Lucky Draw, allowed him to spend points to draw orphan tickets, costing 5000 points each.</p> <p>After looking around, Chen Ye found that the items for exchange were not expensive. Daily necessities and medicines cost 10 points each, while books were a bit pricier, with a comic book version of "Water Margin" costing 50 points.</p> <p>"The skills are too expensive..."</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't help but complain as he looked at the skills, where one draw cost 5000 points.</p> <p>It took Chen Ye about an hour to browse through the functions of the System Mall. Da Ming sat across from him, watching the flickering flames of the lamp with wide eyes, obediently.</p> <p>"Don't stare too much; you'll hurt your eyes."</p> <p>Chen Ye waved his hand in front of Da Ming's eyes and then smiled, "Let's read something."</p> <p>Da Ming shifted his gaze from Chen Ye's face to the bookshelf, his expression interested.</p> <p>With a flick of his left hand, Chen Ye conjured up a book, deducting 50 points from his balance.</p> <p>He placed the book on the table and opened it.</p> <p>"Let's read together, and I'll teach you how to recognize characters. You're already ten years old, not knowing how to read is unacceptable. No matter what you do, you can't be illiterate."</p> <p>Da Ming followed Chen Ye's gaze and saw several colorful characters on the pages, each holding various weapons and engaged in combat.</p> <p>"Come, these three characters, they read as &#8220;Water Margin&#8221;, repeat after director."</p> <p>Seeing Da Ming's apparent interest, Chen Ye couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>"Dad!" Da Ming innocently called out.</p> <p>"No, it's Water Margin, not dad."</p> <p>"Dad!"</p> <p>"Sh&#464; w&#283;i shu&#464;, h&#275; y&#257; h&#250;, zh&#299; y&#257; &#462;n chu&#225;n." (Chinese idiom)</p> <p>"Got it &#8211;- Dad!"</p> <p>"Hey, you little rascal!"</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"The Tenth Chapter: Yang Zhi Escorts the Gold and Silver Cargo, Wu Yong Cunningly Seizes the Birthday Gifts."</p> <p>Chen Ye, spitting with enthusiasm, finished reading the chapter title. He glanced at the Rolex he had just exchanged from the system mall&#8212;it was already ten o'clock at night. {ED: Damn, man has his priorities straight.}</p> <p>Closing the book, he said, "That's enough for today. Let's wash up and go to bed."</p> <p>The past couple of days traveling to Yuhang County, Chen Ye had mostly slept on the roadside, barely getting a good rest. Now that he had his own small house and had set up some bedding, he planned to get a good night's sleep.</p> <p>"Dad! Dad!" Da Ming called out twice, his tone naive and earnest.</p> <p>Chen Ye pushed Da Ming's head away, yawning, "Alright, alright. Let's go to bed."</p> <p>"We need to wake up early to fetch water tomorrow."</p> <p>Da Ming gave the "Water Margin" book one last longing look before obediently following Chen Ye inside.</p> <p>The small room had several beds arranged side by side, enough for the children to sleep comfortably.</p> <p>After exchanging some toothpaste and toothbrushes from the system mall for 5 points, Chen Ye took Da Ming to wash up and then assigned him a bed.</p> <p>As soon as Chen Ye lay down, the system's cold, mechanical voice echoed in his ears.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Daily Settlement activated for having a properly career-planned orphan.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Today, you arrived in Yuhang County, took over the Yuhang Orphanage, and became the orphanage director.

Reward: 30 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;In the evening, you exchanged a "Water Margin" comic book and taught Chen Da Ming to read while accompanying him. Reward: 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Before bed, you helped Chen Da Ming wash up and let him sleep in a warm bed. Reward: 20 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Total: 330 points&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming&#8217;s gratitude towards you has increased!&#12305;</p> <p>Chen Ye, looking at the system prompts, felt a wave of joy.</p> <p>&#8216;The system has such a function?&#8217;</p> <p>Earlier, Chen Ye spent 50 points to exchange for the "Water Margin" comic book, 5 points for toothpaste and toothbrush, and another 20 points for a Rolex watch, leaving him with 25 points.</p> <p>After the daily settlement, Chen Ye's points increased to 355.</p> <p>As the system displayed the settlement information, it brought up Chen Da Ming's data panel.</p> <p>&#12304;Name: Chen Da Ming&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;ID: 0001&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Gender: Male&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 10&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Skills: Strong Physique&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Gratitude: 60%&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Note: Reaching 80% and 100% gratitude will grant an Orphan Skill draw opportunity.&#12305;</p> <p>"80%, 100% chance to draw a Director skill?"</p> <p>"Great!"</p> <p>Chen Ye's eyes lit up. The effect of the "Indestructible Body" trait was still fresh in his memory.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;New mission refreshed!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Mission: Adopt another orphan&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Mission Description: Adopt a second orphan (1/2)&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Mission Rewards: 200 points, 20 taels of silver, one Orphan Skill draw, and unlock building: Study Room&#12305;</p> <p>"Hmm?"</p> <p>&#8216;A new mission already? Not bad.&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye was surprised.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>In the pitch-black night sky, the bright moon hung high, casting its clear glow.</p> <p>Yuhang County, Juke Tavern.</p> <p>The waiter leaned against the counter, nodding off.</p> <p>In the main hall, only one table of guests remained.</p> <p>An oil lamp stood on the wooden table, its flame flickering.</p> <p>Several officers sat around the table.</p> <p>"Brother Song, the brothers have been running around for two days, but we still haven't found a single clue," a tall, skinny constable said with a sigh, holding his wine cup and downing its contents in one gulp.</p> <p>"We've checked all the villages outside the city, but there's no place where the children could be hidden."</p> <p>Another officer with small eyes said.</p> <p>"It's really strange. They just turned around for a moment, and the child was gone. Could it be some kind of witchcraft?" another officer said, taking a bite of his meal.</p> <p>The dark-faced, burly Captain Song sat brooding, then lifted his cup and took a sip.</p> <p>After a moment of contemplation, he spoke, "I've borrowed Thousand Mile Incense from the Liu Shan Men. I'm planning to use Hu Zi as bait."</p> <p>"What?!"</p> <p>"Brother Song, Hu Zi is your own son."</p> <p>"Brother Song, your family has been single-handedly passed down for three generations. This is absolutely unacceptable!"</p> <p>The officers were shocked, not expecting Song to propose such a plan.</p> <p>Song filled his cup, downed it in one gulp, and exhaled, "In one month, nineteen children have gone missing in Yuhang County."</p> <p>"If this continues, the people will lose faith in us."</p> <p>The other officers were stunned into silence, unable to argue with Song Cangjie&#8217;s determination.</p> <p>"There's no need for more discussion. I'll apply the Thousand Mile Incense to Huzi. As long as he's within Lin'an Prefecture, I can find him."</p> <p>Song Cangjie slammed his cup down heavily, making the plates on the table jump. He had made up his mind. The other officers exchanged glances but said no more.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>The next morning.</p> <p>Several rooster crows echoed, long and clear. Chen Ye rubbed his eyes and got up, noticing the sky outside was still a bit dark. He looked at his Rolex watch, it was just five o'clock.</p> <p>"So early?" Chen Ye muttered, lying back down, intending to sleep in.</p> <p>Just as he got comfortable, he heard the continuous sound of water nearby.</p> <p>Chen Ye opened his eyes, thought for a moment, and got up, throwing on his coat before heading outside. The sky was starting to lighten, and at five in the summer, the courtyard was dimly visible.</p> <p>Chen Ye saw a small figure clumsily lifting a water bucket and pouring it into the courtyard&#8217;s water jar.</p> <p>Seeing this scene, Chen Ye hesitated and called out tentatively, "Da Ming?"</p> <p>The figure stopped at the sound of his voice.</p> <p>An innocent voice replied, "Dad."</p> <p>Chen Ye's expression changed slightly, and he walked over to the water jar.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming, with his small frame, was lifting the wooden bucket, pouring water into the jar with a steady flow. Although the movements were clumsy, they were precise and earnest.</p> <p>The once-dry water jar was nearly full.</p> <p>&#8216;This kid&#8230;&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye was momentarily speechless.</p> <p>After a while, Chen Ye picked up another bucket of water and poured it into the jar.</p> <p>Once done, he tossed the bucket aside and wrapped an arm around Da Ming's head, "Go back to sleep."</p> <p>"Waking up this early, aren't you afraid of sudden death?"</p> <p>"If someone sees us, they might think I'm abusing you." Chen Ye&#8217;s tone was gruff as he scolded.</p> <p>Da Ming, confused, followed Chen Ye back inside, not understanding.</p> <p>&#8216;Didn't we say we were going to get up early to fetch water?&#8217;</p> <p>After about two hours, Chen Ye finally got out of bed.</p> <p>"Da Ming?" he called out.</p> <p>"Dad."</p> <p>The thick voice responded from the small bed beside him.</p> <p>Hearing the response, Chen Ye got up slowly and began to help Da Ming wash up.</p> <p>Using the toothbrush and toothpaste he had exchanged from the system mall.</p> <p>After washing up, Chen Ye waved his hand and said, "Da Ming, the director will take you to have breakfast. Whatever you want to eat, just order!"</p> <p>Hearing this, Chen Da Ming's dumbfounded expression changed slightly, and he said with a simple smile, "Dad, I'm hungry."</p> <p>"You really are a reincarnated hungry ghost..." Chen Ye laughed.</p> <p>He led Da Ming out of the orphanage, heading straight for the morning market.</p> <p>At the morning market, people bustled around, and vendors shouted to attract customers. The entire market was shrouded in a white mist.</p> <p>A small boy in a yellow short jacket was holding his father's hand, clutching a sesame seed cake. The man glanced down at his son, a hint of reluctance flashing in his eyes, but he steeled himself, crouching down to his son's level, "Huzi, remember what daddy told you?"</p> <p>The little boy nodded, "If separated from Dad, and someone takes Hu Zi away, Hu Zi will go with them."</p> <p>"Dad will come back to find Hu Zi later."</p> <p>After hearing his son repeat it, Song Cangjie nodded, reluctantly patting his son's head.</p> <p>"What do you want to eat, Hu Zi? Daddy will buy it for you."</p> <p>The boy&#8217;s eyes lit up with joy, "Daddy, I want to eat sugar figures."</p> <p>"Okay, you wait here. Daddy will get it for you."</p> <p>Song Cangjie patted his son's head one last time and then mingled into the crowd.</p> <p>Huzi stood there, his big eyes blinking, waiting for his father to return.</p> <p>Over at a wonton stall, Chen Ye was eating his wontons, watching the scene unfold. That was Song the officer.</p> <p>Is he using his son as bait?</p> <p>Chen Ye easily pieced together what was happening. But it had nothing to do with him. He continued eating his wontons.</p> <p>"Dad, I'm hungry."</p> <p>Chen Da Ming said, setting down his fifth bowl of wontons, his mouth greasy.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s face darkened, "Five bowls, Da Ming? Can your stomach handle that?"</p> <p>After three bowls, Chen Ye was almost full. Da Ming had eaten five and was still not satisfied.</p> <p>Da Ming scratched his head, a puzzled look in his simple eyes.</p> <p>"Boss, two more bowls of wontons," Chen Ye called out.</p> <p>"Alright, please wait a moment!"</p> <p>The boss, holding a large ladle, quickly added more wontons to the pot.</p> <p>Chen Ye snapped back to reality, suddenly startled, "Is the fish biting the hook?"</p> <p>The little boy who had been standing nearby was gone.</p> <p>"Fish?"</p> <p>Da Ming muttered.</p> <p>Chen Ye retorted, "All you know is to eat..."</p> <p>Da Ming blinked and lowered his head, playing with a porcelain bowl while waiting for the wontons.</p> <p>A sudden "crack" echoed, and the bowl in Da Ming's hands split in two. Chen Ye and Da Ming both froze.</p> <p>The boss, who was carrying the wontons over, also paused for a moment. After setting down the wontons, he hurriedly asked, "Sorry, sir, is the young master alright?"</p> <p>The boss looked nervous, fearing Chen Ye would get angry.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at Da Ming with a peculiar expression, shaking his head, "It's fine."</p> <p>The boss picked up the broken bowl, bowing and apologizing, "Sir, I'll give you a free bowl of wontons."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded without saying much.</p> <p>Da Ming looked at Chen Ye with a mix of fear and confusion, as if he thought he had done something wrong. Chen Ye stroked his chin, picked up another wonton bowl, and tried to break it. It didn't break.</p> <p>He handed it to Da Ming, "Da Ming, try it."</p> <p>Da Ming took the porcelain bowl.</p> <p>"Crack," the bowl broke into two halves.</p> <p>&#8220;Ss&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye sucked in a breath.</p> <p>"Is this the effect of the scroll, or is Big Ming naturally gifted with powers?"</p> <p>Chen Ye was shocked, unable to make sense of it. He thought back to Da Ming lifting the sack of rice yesterday.</p> <p>&#8220;Can't believe I just stumbled upon a little genius?" Chen Ye muttered to himself.</p> <p>The trait &#12304;Strong Physique&#12305; suggested rapid strength growth over time. Since he had given the trait to Da Ming only a day ago, it couldn't be the trait's effect.</p> <p>"Heh, interesting," Chen Ye chuckled.</p> <p>The little beggar he picked up had a natural gift for strength!</p> <p>Da Ming quietly put the broken bowl back on the table, avoiding Chen Ye's gaze.</p> <p>The boss, hearing the bowl crack again, turned around, surprised.</p> <p>"Boss, we don't need the free wontons. Just charge for the bowl," Chen Ye called out.</p> <p>He kept his eyes on Da Ming, marveling at the discovery.</p> <p>Da Ming stared at the wontons, swallowing hard.</p> <p>"Go ahead and eat," Chen Ye said.</p> <p>Da Ming began to wolf down the food. Chen Ye watched his gluttonous son, his eyes gleaming with interest.</p> <p>Natural strength, combined with the &#12304;Strong Physique&#12305; skill, meant that over time, as Da Ming grew, his strength would become immense.</p> <p>Chen Ye was amazed. If there were truly martial sects in this world, things could get interesting. After finishing their wontons, they left the stall.</p> <p>Da Ming burped loudly, looking content and dazed.</p> <p>Chen Ye rubbed Big Ming's head, feeling a bit exasperated. "It's not like it's the only meal you'll ever have, is it?"</p> <p>Da Ming looking foolish, followed beside Chen Ye.</p> <p>"Next, let's buy two old hens. Eggs were quite valuable in ancient times."</p> <p>Chen Ye was making plans as he walked along. Da Ming trailed behind Chen Ye, suddenly stopping and staring at something.</p> <p>A young man, reeking of perfume and with dark circles under his eyes, walked unsteadily, holding a folding fan.</p> <p>Da Ming's simple mind recalled the conversation between Chen Ye and the boss yesterday. With a vague sense of purpose, Da Ming approached the young man. Just as Da Ming grabbed the fan, he felt a shock and couldn&#8217;t move.</p> <p>A black cloth covered his face, and he lost consciousness.</p> <p>Chen Ye, walking along the street, suddenly felt something was amiss. Turning around, his face changed dramatically.</p> <p>"Da Ming?"</p> <p>The bustling crowd showed no sign of Chen Da Ming.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Bang~</p> <p>Chen Da Ming felt himself being thrown heavily onto the ground. He opened his eyes and found himself lying on the floor, surrounded by five or six other children about his age.</p> <p>Clang~</p> <p>The sound of chains echoed.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming looked in the direction of the sound.</p> <p>A man with a plain face and a sinister look in his eyes stood outside the wooden fence gate, looping a chain around it several times to lock it.</p> <p>The man noticed Chen Da Ming's gaze and glared at him fiercely.</p> <p>After noticing Da Ming's blank expression, he exclaimed, "Why is there a fool here?"</p> <p>"Hmm... I didn't notice when I caught him."</p> <p>The man pondered for a moment, then shrugged it off, turning to shout, "Apply acupuncture to the mute points every two hours."</p> <p>"Remember to give him some water to drink. Don't let him die. Huang, make sure nobody dies."</p> <p>"Got it... hic..."</p> <p>Inside the room, a disheveled man sprawled on a table, holding a chicken bone in his hand. Beside him were four or five wine jars, his face flushed and greasy from eating.</p> <p>The sinister-eyed man covered his nose, looking at the disheveled man with disdain.</p> <p>The children had to relieve themselves in the room, and he couldn't imagine how anyone could eat amidst the stench. He didn't linger, pushing the door open to leave.</p> <p>The room was left with a group of children and the disheveled man, separated by a wooden fence gate.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming stood up and saw a boy in a yellow short-sleeved shirt next to him. The boy opened his mouth but couldn't make a sound.</p> <p>The only noise in the room was the sound of the disheveled man gnawing on the chicken bone. Occasionally, the man would pick up a wine jar and take a big gulp, letting out a satisfied sigh.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming stood dumbly, then suddenly remembered the thing he was supposed to give to his dad.</p> <p>He looked down to see a pink fan in his hand. Seeing that the fan was still there, Da Ming smiled with joy and quickly tucked it into his shirt. Once the fan was safely inside, he patted it through his clothes and smiled foolishly.</p> <p>Dad said we could talk about this when we had money.</p> <p>He thought his dad would be very happy when he gave it to him.</p> <p>Da Ming, with his simple thoughts, found a spot against the wall to sit down, staring blankly at the ground, waiting for his dad to come and get him.</p> <p>He didn't notice a little girl in a green dress with a face smeared with dirt watching him for a long time.</p> <p>Xiao Lian took her gaze off the two new children, her eyes dimming. She buried her dirt-smeared face in her knees, feeling utterly hopeless.</p> <p>Would she be sold to a brothel?</p> <p>The thought made Xiao Lian's body tremble and her limbs go cold. Despair filled her heart.</p> <p>Mother, if they sell me to a brothel, I will come to join you...</p> <p>Xiao Lian gripped her dress tightly, the veins standing out on her pale hands, filled with resolve. The other children sat on the floor, eyes red and swollen from crying. Some tried to touch the wooden fence, but a chicken bone would fly at them, hitting their fingers and making them cry silently.</p> <p>After a few tries, no one dared to touch the fence again.</p> <p>The disheveled man finished his wine and looked drunkenly at the children, yawning. He stumbled to the bed and collapsed, snoring loudly.</p> <p>Seeing this, a glimmer of hope sparked in Xiao Lian's eyes.</p> <p>A chance!</p> <p>If she could get the key, she could escape.</p> <p>She glanced around the room, her hope fading as quickly as it came. The key hung from the man's waist, impossible to reach.</p> <p>Unwilling, Xiao Lian bit her lip, her eyes losing their light.</p> <p>Most of the children had cried themselves to sleep, their eyes swollen. Only Chen Da Ming sat there, staring blankly at the ground.</p> <p>Suddenly, he stood up and walked to the wooden gate, banging on it with all his might.</p> <p>The room filled with the clanging of iron chains. The children woke up in shock, realizing they were still trapped, and started crying silently again. The drunken man snored loudly, oblivious to the noise.</p> <p>Da Ming's dumb face showed anxiety as he kept banging on the wooden fence.</p> <p>Why hasn't dad come to get me?</p> <p>In Da Ming's mind suddenly came a frightening possibility &#8211; could it be that Dad doesn't want me anymore?</p> <p>With this thought, tears welled up in Da Ming's eyes. His grip tightened, exerting more force, his mouth open wide as if to call out for Dad, but no sound came out.</p> <p>Beside him, Xiao Lian, who had been lowering her head, was drawn to Da Ming's movements. She lifted her head, her face filled with astonishment as she watched Da Ming.</p> <p>With each hit, she noticed, the wooden fence trembled slightly.</p> <p>&#8216;This fool has quite the strength.&#8217; Xiao Lian thought to herself.</p> <p>After observing for a moment, she lowered her head again, trying to think of a way out.</p> <p>Seeing no one coming to let him out, Chen Da Ming became even more anxious. He grabbed the wooden bars of the gate and shook them with all his might.</p> <p>The gate shook but remained firm.</p> <p>Da Ming's eyes grew redder, as if blood could drip from them. He took a few steps back and rammed into the gate with all his strength.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The sound was so loud that the drunken man on the bed furrowed his brows, turned over, and continued sleeping.</p> <p>The loud noise drew the attention of the other children. They all looked up, watching the fool bang against the gate. Xiao Lian looked up too, her eyes dull.</p> <p>Suddenly, she noticed that one of the wooden bars was bending!</p> <p>How is that possible?</p> <p>Xiao Lian's eyes widened in disbelief. She looked at Chen Da Ming. This fool seemed younger than her, yet his strength was incredible.</p> <p>Da Ming panted heavily, his eyes bloodshot. He rammed into the gate several more times.</p> <p>One of the wooden bars bent more and more under the children's astonished gazes.</p> <p>Finally,.</p> <p>Kachak~</p> <p>A loud snap echoed.</p> <p>A wooden bar as thick as a bowl broke in half, and Da Ming crashed through, falling to the ground.</p> <p>The other children stared at the broken bar in disbelief. Xiao Lian was stunned for a few seconds but quickly reacted, her face lighting up with joy.</p> <p>A bar as thick as a bowl was really broken by this fool! Great, this is our chance, we can escape!</p> <p>The gap between the bars was small, but with one bar broken, it was just enough for a child to squeeze through.</p> <p>Xiao Lian glanced at the drunken man, who was still snoring, and suppressed her excitement. She gestured for the children to stay quiet and then led them through the broken gate to the other side of the room.</p> <p>The children were overjoyed, some of them sobbing silently, wanting to shout but unable to.</p> <p>Xiao Lian urged them to stay quiet. She cautiously walked to the door, pushed it open, and peeked outside.</p> <p>It was a normal courtyard, and no one was around.</p> <p>Xiao Lian breathed a sigh of relief and signaled the children to follow her one by one. Da Ming, having gotten up from the ground, his eyes bloodshot, wanted to follow the other children and find Chen Ye.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's eyes flickered with an idea, and she grabbed Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming was puzzled, not understanding why this girl was holding him back. Xiao Lian pointed to the back window, signaling Da Ming to follow her there.</p> <p>Da Ming stood there dumbly, looking at the door, then the back window, confused.</p> <p>Xiao Lian opened the back window, seeing it led directly to the backyard. She breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>She turned to see Da Ming still standing there, and couldn't help but twitch her mouth in frustration.</p> <p>This fool!</p> <p>She dragged Da Ming to the back window. As they moved, she noticed several unopened wine jars under the table.</p> <p>A cold glint flashed in her eyes.</p> <p>She pushed Da Ming to the back window, opened one of the wine jars, and poured the liquid all over the room.</p> <p>Then, Xiao Lian took out a pair of firestones from her pocket, lit the oil lamp on the table, and prepared to set the bed on fire.</p> <p>As she moved, she noticed a book with a purple cover sticking out of the disheveled man's clothes. She carefully pulled it out.</p> <p>The cover read &#8220;Jin Hua Zhi (Amazing Finger Techniques).&#8221; {ED: That&#8217;s what she said.}</p> <p>No time to think, Xiao Lian stuffed the book into her own pocket, walked to the back window, and threw the lit oil lamp onto the bed.</p> <p>The oil from the lamp spilled out, and the flames ignited.</p> <p>Instantly, the bed was engulfed in flames.</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked back, seeing Da Ming still standing at the window, and felt a surge of anger.</p> <p>This fool!</p> <p>She pulled Da Ming and jumped out of the back window.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>A blade emitting a cold gleam swiftly enlarged in front of Shi Shisan's eyes. Shi Shisan's hair stood on end, and cold sweat broke out on his back. He quickly leaned back, dodging the rapidly approaching blade.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The long blade fiercely struck the ground, splitting the stone slab road into two halves.</p> <p>The wielder of the long blade wore a black robe, with a dark complexion.</p> <p>Seeing his opponent evade his attack, Song Cangjie's eyes turned fierce, and he swung his long blade again towards Shi Shisan. After dodging the ambush, Shi Shisan focused his gaze and realized that the attacker was just an ordinary martial artist, nothing to be feared, and sneered,</p> <p>"Just a mediocre martial artist."</p> <p>Shi Shisan's eyes turned sharp as he swiftly kicked out with his legs, his moves fierce and unstoppable. Despite several attempts, Song Cangjie's long blade fell short of striking Shi Shisan by mere centimeters each time, unable to land a hit.</p> <p>After a few exchanges, Song Cangjie's chest was kicked, his face turning pale as he staggered back several steps.</p> <p>Several undercover officers hiding nearby rushed forward, their black-clothed figures wielding long blades that hummed as they swung.</p> <p>Ting~ Tang~</p> <p>After a few clashes, the officers' long blades were all kicked out of their hands by Shi Shisan, their faces flushed with exertion and injuries.</p> <p>Song Cangjie's face turned pale as he recognized the opponent's martial arts style.</p> <p>"The Yu Luo Leg Technique of the Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Shi Shisan adjusted his robe, his eyes sharp as he stared at Song Cangjie, coldly saying, "You've got some knowledge."</p> <p>&#8216;The opponent was from the Fengyu Tower?&#8217;</p> <p>Song Cangjie's face changed drastically, filled with shock.</p> <p>The Fengyu Tower was the most elite assassination organization in the martial world, with numerous assassins.</p> <p>It was said that the master of the Fengyu Tower had reached the pinnacle of martial arts, almost reaching the level of a Grandmaster, and had once assassinated an elder of the Huashan Sect. He had engaged in several duels with the head of the Huashan Sect after being discovered, without falling behind.</p> <p>Recalling the information about the Fengyu Tower, Song Cangjie's face became extremely grim. He couldn't understand why the disappearance of a few children would involve the shadow of the Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Skipping back half an hour.</p> <p>After several days of investigation, Song Cangjie had finally found a pattern in the children's disappearances - All the children were lost in crowded markets, indicating that the perpetrator specifically targeted crowded places.</p> <p>So, Song Cangjie left a trail on Hu Zi, dumping him in the morning market.</p> <p>To avoid attracting attention, Song Cangjie intentionally bought a sugar figure at a sugar sculpture stall. When he returned, Hu Zi disappeared just as he had anticipated.</p> <p>Song Cangjie pretended to react like other parents of lost children, shouting loudly in the morning market.</p> <p>Then, he quickly gathered manpower and took out the &#8220;Xun Xiang Feng (Fragrant-Seeking Bee)".</p> <p>The "Xun Xiang Feng" is a special type of bee cultivated by the Liu Shan Men, capable of tracking the scent of a thousand miles away.</p> <p>Releasing the Xun Xiang Feng, Song Cangjie, along with other officers, quickly tracked it. After circling the city for a long time, Song Cangjie and the officers were led by the Xun Xiang Feng to a relatively remote mansion in Yuhang County.</p> <p>At the sight of the mansion, all the officers turned pale. Because it belonged to Liu, the county magistrate of Yuhang.</p> <p>Seeing the mansion, Song Cangjie finally understood why the number of missing children had increased in recent days, and why Liu, the magistrate, hadn't said much but just urged him to speed up the investigation.</p> <p>It just didn&#8217;t fit with Magistrate Liu's style of acting decisively and swiftly.</p> <p>At the same time, Song Cangjie also understood why they hadn't found any clues in the villages near the city.</p> <p>The children had been hidden within the city!</p> <p>The group of officers crouched on the roof of a nearby civilian house, exchanging glances, but no one spoke. This situation was beyond their expectations.</p> <p>Only Song Cangjie's expression was constantly changing, looking extremely unpleasant.</p> <p>Just as they were unsure how to proceed, a figure dressed in a long robe, with an unremarkable appearance, walked out of the mansion. It was Shi Shisan.</p> <p>Song Cangjie no longer hesitated and whispered to his subordinates, &#8220;This matter concerns the reputation of Yuhang County. We cannot sit idly by.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;If it's truly related to County Magistrate Liu, I will report it to the Liu Shan Men&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing the mention of the Liu Shan Men, the other officers' spirits were lifted. The reputation of the Liu Shan Men was much greater than that of County Magistrate Liu.</p> <p>As far as the officers knew, officer Song Cangjie had once served in the Liu Shan Men, but for some unknown reason, he was dismissed and had to return to Yuhang County as an officer. If it was related to Song Cangjie, he could take the responsibility for this matter.</p> <p>Then the officers would have no worries.</p> <p>After Song Cangjie flipped down from the civilian house, he looked around and realized that County Magistrate Liu's mansion was in a remote location, with no pedestrians around.</p> <p>He accurately predicted the direction Shi Shisan would come from and hid behind a wall. When Shi Shisan approached, he attacked.</p> <p>However, the knife that was supposed to hit him was dodged by the opponent.</p> <p>Shi Shisan then displayed the '&#8221;Yu Luo Leg Technique&#8221; of the Fengyu Tower, injuring several people.</p> <p>Song Cangjie held his chest, trying to calm the injuries with his meager internal strength.</p> <p>"Fengyu Tower, why did you kidnap the children? You're only supposed to do assassination business, aren't you?" Song Cangjie asked with a tense expression.</p> <p>Shi Shisan didn't respond to Song Cangjie's question, as if Song Cangjie wasn't worth his answer.</p> <p>Furrowing his brows, Shi Shisan muttered to himself, "This shouldn't be..."</p> <p>"You're just an insignificant martial artist, how could you possibly find this place?" Shi Shisan pondered, unable to understand the situation.</p> <p>"Forget it, thinking about this is pointless. Anyway, taking these children out of the city should be enough to explain everything." Shi Shisan's gaze fell upon the group of officers, his eyes narrowing coldly.</p> <p>A faint murderous intent enveloped the constables, causing them to shiver and pale.</p> <p>This kind of murderous intent wasn't something an ordinary person could possess; only someone with dozens of lives on their hands could.</p> <p>Song Cangjie, not receiving an answer, had a dark and uncertain expression. He glanced occasionally towards the mansion behind Shi Shisan. His son, Huzi, was in there after all. Though he didn't know why the Fengyu Tower kidnapped children, it definitely wasn't a good thing.</p> <p>Song Cangjie's grip tightened on his long knife, his eyes showing a hint of determination.</p> <p>"Oh? A dying struggle?" Shi Shisan coldly snorted, stepping slowly towards Song Cangjie.</p> <p>The distance between the two was getting shorter and shorter. With each step Shi Shisan took, his aura became increasingly powerful in Song Cangjie's eyes.</p> <p>"Bronze Badge Killer," Song Cangjie stared closely at Shi Shisan, slowly speaking.</p> <p>Shi Shisan's face showed surprise, nodding, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got some insight. Then, I'll tell you all about it before you die a ghost."</p> <p>"I&#8217;m a Bronze Badge Killer of the Fengyu Tower &#8212; Shi Shisan."</p> <p>With this response, Song Cangjie felt an invisible relief. The Fengyu Tower's Bronze Badge Killers were generally fourth-grade martial artists. The opponent's strength was only one grade higher than his own.</p> <p>With that move&#8230; He could kill!</p> <p>Song Cangjie took a deep breath, tightening his grip on the long knife. The bright blade reflected the sunlight, casting a shimmering spot on the ground. The other constables also picked up their long knives, gripping the handles tightly as they glared angrily at Shi Shisan.</p> <p>The two sides faced off, their momentum reaching its peak, ready to erupt into a bloody battle at any moment.</p> <p>All of this was observed by Chen Ye, who had just hidden around the corner after the previous skirmish.</p> <p>&#8216;There really are martial arts sects!&#8217;</p> <p>&#8216;Fengyu Tower, and a bronze medal assassin!&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye's eyes showed excitement.</p> <p>What was originally a boring day in his eyes suddenly became interesting in the ancient world.</p> <p>Chen Ye exhaled deeply, and a virtual blue interface appeared with a red dot on it, indicating the location not far away.</p> <p>During the morning market, Chen Ye found that Da Ming was missing. He immediately contacted the virtual system. After discovering that the system had a tracking function, Chen Ye's suspended heart suddenly dropped.</p> <p>It made sense when he thought about it. The purpose of the system was to foster orphans. If the children were kidnapped by human traffickers, then what would be the point of fostering them?</p> <p>Suppressing his excited emotions, Chen Ye carefully watched the situation unfold.</p> <p>"It looks like these constables are no match for that Bronze Badge Killer."</p> <p>&#8216;Song Cangjie is just an insignificant martial artist. Could this be the grade of martial artists? What grade is that man?&#8217;</p> <p>Seeing both sides in a stalemate, on the verge of a bloody battle, Chen Ye couldn't help but ponder.</p> <p>If Song Cangjie won, that would be good, and maybe Da Ming could be rescued.</p> <p>But if he failed...</p> <p>He could only lament silently; Rest in peace, Da Ming.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, Chen Ye made up his mind.</p> <p>He spent 5 points of his accumulation to exchange for a set of night clothes from the virtual system and quickly changed into them.</p> <p>Then he put two copper coins in his mouth, so that when he spoke, he wouldn't be easily recognized. With preparations made, Chen Ye took a step forward.</p> <p>Shi Shisan's face showed a smile that seemed like a sneer, taking steps towards Song Cangjie.</p> <p>The distance between the two was getting closer and closer. The constables surrounding him with long knives seemed to pose no threat in his eyes.</p> <p>And indeed, it was the case. The constables around him were just ordinary people, not martial artists.</p> <p>Song Cangjie mobilized the internal energy in his body, calculating the distance between himself and Shi Shisan.</p> <p>As Shi Shisan stepped within five steps, he reversed his internal energy.</p> <p>The pressure between the two sides reached its peak. Sweat dripped from the foreheads of the officers, one drop sliding down a officer's face and falling onto the ground.</p> <p>A drop of dark water appeared on the stone pavement.</p> <p>At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared on the empty street.</p> <p>Seeing the sudden appearance of the figure, Shi Shisan's steps faltered, and a cautious look appeared on his face.</p> <p>Several officers also noticed Shi Shisan's change and turned their attention to the street corner.</p> <p>At first, Song Cangjie thought it might be a martial artist, but he noticed the figure's unsteady gait, lacking the smoothness of a martial artist's stride. It was just an ordinary person, causing a hint of disappointment to flash in his eyes.</p> <p>Immediately, he shouted loudly, "This is official business, everyone else should leave immediately!"</p> <p>Song Cangjie's words were meant to protect the person in black.</p> <p>Shi Shisan's strength was at the fourth level, and facing ordinary people would only lead to a dead end.</p> <p>Hearing this, Chen Ye secretly nodded. This head officer was quite something.</p> <p>However, he did not stop his steps because of these words. Instead, he walked boldly and confidently to the center of the confrontation.</p> <p>"Another one looking for death," Shi Shisan sneered.</p> <p>Since Song Cangjie could discern that the person in black had no martial arts skills, he naturally could as well.</p> <p>Chen Ye stopped in his tracks, pretending to have just noticed the situation after hearing the voice.</p> <p>Coming to a halt, Chen Ye listened intently, feigning interest. His gaze, indifferent, rested on Shi Shisan as he asked ambiguously, "An assassin from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>The mention of this sparked alarm among the bystanders.</p> <p>Shi Shisan was astonished to have his identity exposed by just one glance from Chen Ye.</p> <p>Who was this person?</p> <p>"Who are you?" Shi Shisan became cautious at Chen Ye's words.</p> <p>Chen Ye, seeing Shi Shisan's apprehension, remained composed and said, "What about it?"</p> <p>"You abducted my disciple. Shouldn't I come knocking on your door?"</p> <p>Hearing these words, Shi Shisan was greatly shocked.</p> <p>That these officers could find this place was already beyond his expectations. And now another person in black has come.</p> <p>&#8216;Is my movement technique really that bad?&#8217;</p> <p>Shi Shisan couldn&#8217;t help but doubt himself.</p> <p>The surrounding officers were also shocked by the words of the man in black.</p> <p>Song Cangjie looked puzzled and uncertain, unable to grasp the current situation. The person in black looked unskilled at a glance, appearing to be an ordinary person.</p> <p>But why did his words sound like those of a highly skilled martial artist?</p> <p>Chen Ye stood in the center of the confrontation, his gaze remained indifferent, as if nothing in the world mattered to him.</p> <p>&#8216;I wonder if I can bluff my way out of this&#8230;&#8217;</p> <p>On the surface, Chen Ye looked calm and composed, but inside, he was extremely nervous.</p> <p>His only reliance was the "Indestructible Body" skill.</p> <p>After a moment of hesitation, Shi Shisan regained his composure. As an assassin, there&#8217;s no way he could be frightened away.</p> <p>Moreover, when the person in black appeared, he seemed completely devoid of martial skills.</p> <p>"Pretending to be mysterious..."</p> <p>Shi Shisan sneered coldly, his eyes icy. With a flick of his robe, he stepped forward, ready to strike.</p> <p>Before Shi Shisan could act, Chen Ye interjected, "Junior from Fengyu Tower..."</p> <p>"You've abducted my disciple, so logically, I should execute you here. However, considering our past with Fengyu Tower, I'll give you three moves."</p> <p>"Come at me."</p> <p>Chen Ye's ambiguous words stunned everyone present.</p> <p>Shi Shisan widened his eyes in disbelief, wondering if he had misheard.</p> <p>The surrounding constables were equally astonished.</p> <p>Song Cangjie, perplexed, couldn't comprehend how the person in black could possess such strength.</p> <p>&#8216;Could it be&#8230;&#8217;</p> <p>He suddenly thought of a possibility.</p> <p>When Song Cangjie was serving in the Liu Shan Men, he had heard that martial arts masters could reach a level of control where they could act as if they had never trained in martial arts, blending seamlessly with ordinary people.</p> <p>Could it be that this person in black is a grandmaster?</p> <p>How could this be!</p> <p>How could there be a grandmaster hidden in a small place like Yuhang County?</p> <p>At that moment, the scene fell silent.</p> <p>Shi Shisan was the first to react, refusing to believe that the person in black was a master.</p> <p>In Yuhang County, even having a second-rate constable was remarkable. How could there be a master hiding here?</p> <p>However, Shi Shisan retained a shred of caution. Better safe than sorry.</p> <p>Could this person truly be a hidden master? Under Fengyu Tower's notorious reputation, he might not escape death.</p> <p>Shi Shisan pondered, clenching his hands, "Senior, I'll make my move."</p> <p>With a disdainful snort, Chen Ye remained calm, maintaining the demeanor of a superior.</p> <p>It seemed as though he was certain that Shi Shisan's attack wouldn't harm him.</p> <p>Shi Shisan saw the calm composure of the man in black and activated his internal energy, circulating it according to the path of the Yu Luo Leg Technique.</p> <p>Suddenly, he took a step forward, his legs producing multiple afterimages, moving so fast they were almost invisible.</p> <p>Ding!</p> <p>A metallic sound rang out.</p> <p>Shi Shisan had returned to his original position, as if he had never moved at all.</p> <p>The officers looked at each other, confused, as they hadn't been able to see what had just happened.</p> <p>Only Song Cangjie saw what had transpired. Shi Shisan had used his Yu Luo Leg Technique to kick the man in black in the chest. That strike contained eighty percent of Shi Shisan's internal energy, something even a third-grade martial artist would not dare to take head-on.</p> <p>Yet the man in black hadn't moved at all, standing there as solid as a rock, letting Shi Shisan's kick land on him.</p> <p>Song Cangjie was stunned. He was genuinely astonished.</p> <p>What shocked him even more was that the man in black spoke.</p> <p>"Not bad, among bronze-ranked assassins, your kick is among the best."</p> <p>Chen Ye's voice was muffled and his tone indifferent. He appeared calm on the outside but was actually shocked inside.</p> <p>So fast.</p> <p>Chen Ye hadn't even seen how the other person made a move; he only heard the sound of metal clashing against his chest.</p> <p>Fortunately, the &#12304;Indestructible Body&#12305; trait given by the system was truly powerful. Despite taking the hit, he felt nothing at all. It didn't even hurt, and the force was entirely dissipated.</p> <p>Seeing that the man in black was unscathed, Shi Shisan stood there in disbelief, his limbs cold.</p> <p>How is this possible!</p> <p>That kick had used eighty percent of his internal energy, aimed at the heart. Even a martial artist of the same level would have been killed by it.</p> <p>How could this man in black be completely unharmed!</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't give Shi Shisan a chance to catch his breath and took a step forward, saying calmly, "Two more moves."</p> <p>Hearing this, Shi Shisan completely lost the will to continue fighting. His expression changed, and recognizing the situation, he knelt down, kowtowing three times. "Senior, I was blind and captured your disciple. Please, on behalf of my sect master, show mercy and spare me."</p> <p>Sect master?</p> <p>Hearing this term, Chen Ye pondered for a moment. Without looking at Shi Shisan, he said in a muffled voice, "Leave."</p> <p>"Thank you, senior!"</p> <p>Shi Shisan didn't hesitate, using his light footwork to scale the wall and disappear in an instant.</p> <p>A potentially bloody battle was thus averted.</p> <p>The constables present were all stunned, looking at each other in confusion.</p> <p>Only Song Cangjie reacted first, respectfully clasping his fists, "Thank you, senior, for your assistance."</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at Song Cangjie indifferently, maintaining the demeanor of a lofty expert without speaking.</p> <p>Suddenly, the door of a nearby residence opened, and a few small heads peeked out.</p> <p>Song Cangjie saw this and exclaimed, "Hu&#8217;er!"</p> <p>The child in the yellow short shirt saw his father and ran over with teary eyes.</p> <p>The other constables also rushed towards the children.</p> <p>Chen Ye frowned slightly at the sight.</p> <p>What's going on? How did these kids get out?</p> <p>He called up the system and saw that the large red dot had moved to the next street.</p> <p>Hmm?</p> <p>Why is Da Ming running that way?</p> <p>Without lingering any longer, Chen Ye turned and headed towards the other street. At the corner, he quickly removed his night attire, revealing his original appearance.</p> <p>By the time the officers noticed, the man in black had already disappeared. {ED: Ah, the classic Batman trick}</p> <p>"Where is that senior?" the tall, thin constable whispered.</p> <p>Hugging his son, Song Cangjie glanced at the empty street and said solemnly, "A senior of that caliber is beyond our comprehension."</p> <p>"Captain, the house is on fire!" shouted the small-eyed constable.</p> <p>Song Cangjie quickly looked over and saw black smoke rising from Liu Xian's residence. Inside, a man's scream of agony could be heard.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Yuhang County, Wutong Street.</p> <p>&#8220;Huff&#8230; huff&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian rested her hands on her knees, panting heavily with her rosy little mouth wide open.</p> <p>She turned to glance at Da Ming beside her. Da Ming still had that dumbfounded look, having run all this way without even breaking a sweat.</p> <p>"How come you&#8217;re not even out of breath?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s clear, melodious voice rang out as she spoke, her lively eyes filled with surprise.</p> <p>Da Ming blinked and stared blankly at Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Suddenly, as if remembering something, he reached into his pocket with his right hand. Feeling the fan in his pocket, a silly smile appeared on Da Ming&#8217;s face.</p> <p>&#8216;The fan was still there. Dad would be so happy to see it.&#8217;</p> <p>Thinking of this, Da Ming tilted his head and looked around, a confused look in his eyes.</p> <p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s this? Why did it feel so familiar?&#8217;</p> <p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s Dad?&#8217;</p> <p>Da Ming opened his mouth, wanting to call out for his dad, but no sound came out.</p> <p>"Don&#8217;t bother. Your mute acupoint was sealed. It&#8217;ll be at least another hour before you can speak."</p> <p>Xiao Lian patted her chest and took a deep breath before speaking.</p> <p>After saying that, she muttered to herself, "Wait, why am I telling you this..."</p> <p>"You can&#8217;t understand anyway."</p> <p>After observing Da Ming, Xiao Lian was convinced that he was just a strong but simple-minded fool.</p> <p>Xiao Lian lifted her head to look around, recognizing that they were on Wutong Street, just two streets away from the north side of the city.</p> <p>"Hey dummy, do you remember where your house is?" Xiao Lian withdrew her gaze and looked back at Da Ming with her bright eyes.</p> <p>Just as she turned her head, a young man in coarse clothes came running over, his face filled with excitement, and grabbed Da Ming in an embrace.</p> <p>"Da Ming!"</p> <p>Hearing the familiar voice, Chen Da Ming turned around in surprise. The moment he saw Chen Ye, he froze.</p> <p>Then, his eyes reddened, and tears started streaming down his face. Da Ming began to cry loudly, hugging Chen Ye's legs, unable to stop.</p> <p>Seeing Da Ming like this, Chen Ye felt a mix of emotions&#8212;relief, touched, and a bit of heartache.</p> <p>"Wait a minute, Da Ming, why can&#8217;t you make any sound?"</p> <p>Chen Ye noticed something was wrong. Da Ming was wailing, but not a single sound came out.</p> <p>Panic set in, and Chen Ye pried Da Ming&#8217;s mouth open to check his tongue and throat.</p> <p>"He had his mute acupoint sealed. It&#8217;ll be at least another hour before he can speak again."</p> <p>A clear, pleasant voice came from beside him.</p> <p>Chen Ye then noticed the child standing nearby.</p> <p>This child was slightly taller than Da Ming, wearing a faded blue dress, and her face was smeared with mud, making it impossible to see her true appearance.</p> <p>But from the voice, it was clear that she was a girl.</p> <p>"Oh, so his mute acupoint was sealed."</p> <p>Hearing the explanation from the little girl, Chen Ye breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>Having just witnessed a fierce battle between assassins from Fengyu Tower and the local constables, he had already accepted the existence of martial arts and sects in this world.</p> <p>If martial arts existed, then so did acupoints and such things.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the muddy-faced girl and asked, "Who are you?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s eyes lowered slightly, a trace of caution flashing in them.</p> <p>"I&#8217;m Xiao Lian, a child from around here."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded at this explanation, not asking further.</p> <p>How could a local child know that Da Ming had his mute acupoint sealed?</p> <p>And why was her face covered in mud?</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t dwell on it. He bent down and squatted in front of Da Ming.</p> <p>"Da Ming, how did you manage to get out?"</p> <p>"Does anything hurt?"</p> <p>"Tell Director about it."</p> <p>Da Ming understood the question and shook his head.</p> <p>Unconvinced, Chen Ye checked him over and found nothing wrong with his arms and legs. But when he touched Da Ming&#8217;s shoulder, he flinched.</p> <p>"Hold still, let me take a look."</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s face turned serious as he pulled back Da Ming&#8217;s collar, revealing a bruise on his shoulder.</p> <p>"Ouch!"</p> <p>Seeing the bruise, anger flashed across Chen Ye&#8217;s face. In that moment, he felt a surge of emotions, like a parent whose child had been bullied.</p> <p>"Let&#8217;s go, Da Ming. Director needs to get you some medicine!"</p> <p>Chen Ye mentally noted down a grudge against Fengyu Tower. When he got stronger, he would definitely deal with their master.</p> <p>Human traffickers must die.</p> <p>Chen Ye pulled Da Ming, but Da Ming stood there, unmoving.</p> <p>"What's wrong, Da Ming?" Chen Ye didn&#8217;t understand why Da Ming wouldn&#8217;t move.</p> <p>Tears welled up in Da Ming&#8217;s eyes as he turned to look at Xiao Lian, staring at her before glancing back at Chen Ye. Seeing Da Ming&#8217;s actions, Xiao Lian&#8217;s expression turned wary, and she took a step back, looking like she might run at any moment.</p> <p>Chen Ye thought for a moment and roughly understood what was going on.</p> <p>Earlier, the other children had all left through the main gate, but only Da Ming and this little girl beside him had taken a different route.</p> <p>Considering the contradictions in this girl's knowledge and appearance, Chen Ye could guess what had happened.</p> <p>This little girl had likely led Da Ming out another way to avoid any guards at the gate, showing her cleverness.</p> <p>And the caution in her eyes made Chen Ye think.</p> <p>&#8216;If this child were an orphan, that would be perfect.&#8217;</p> <p>He just happened to have a "Dexterous Hands" skill that would suit a girl perfectly.</p> <p>After a moment&#8217;s thought, Chen Ye softened his expression and said kindly, "I&#8217;m the director of the Yuhang Orphanage."</p> <p>"If you don&#8217;t have anywhere to go for now, you can come with us."</p> <p>Xiao Lian was surprised to hear Chen Ye&#8217;s words.</p> <p>She had assumed Chen Ye was Da Ming&#8217;s father, but it turned out he was the orphanage director.</p> <p>She carefully studied Chen Ye and Da Ming&#8217;s features&#8212;they didn&#8217;t look alike.</p> <p>Chen Ye, having said what he wanted, paid no more attention to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>If this clever child decided to come along, that would be great. If not, it didn&#8217;t matter.</p> <p>Maybe she wasn&#8217;t even an orphan.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye preparing to leave with Da Ming, Xiao Lian hesitated for a moment, then called out in a clear voice, "How did you know that he ran this way?"</p> <p>After speaking, she took a few steps back.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s words had made her think deeply.</p> <p>She didn&#8217;t want to assume the worst about people, but she wasn&#8217;t naive either.</p> <p>Xiao Lian had made it all the way from Jianing Prefecture to Lin&#8217;an Prefecture by being cautious.</p> <p>Some orphanages were no different from human traffickers.</p> <p>They&#8217;d receive a child one moment and sell them the next.</p> <p>Hearing her question, Chen Ye stopped and smiled, saying, "I saw a group of children running out earlier, but I didn&#8217;t see Da Ming, so I came to look for him in the adjacent streets."</p> <p>With that, Chen Ye continued leading Da Ming toward the orphanage.</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood still, watching Chen Ye&#8217;s retreating figure, her eyes thoughtful.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>"Da Ming, come lie down on the bench. I&#8217;ll put some medicine on you."</p> <p>In the middle of the courtyard was a bench. Chen Ye held a bottle of Safflower Oil he had just exchanged from the system store.</p> <p>Da Ming dumbly lay down on the bench. As soon as he did, he flinched. {ED: Why do we have to bully Da Ming like this! My man did nothing wrong!}</p> <p>Quickly getting up, he pulled out a pink fan from his pocket and handed it to Chen Ye. Da Ming looked at Chen Ye, grinning, mouthing words without sound.</p> <p>Chen Ye was momentarily taken aback by the fan Da Ming handed over.</p> <p>"Hey, where did you pick this up?"</p> <p>Chen Ye recognized it at once as one of the fans used by the girls at the Yi Hong Courtyard, and his expression turned peculiar.</p> <p>Da Ming dumbly mouthed a word.</p> <p>Chen Ye understood the silent voice.</p> <p>"Alright, I&#8217;ll keep it."</p> <p>Chen Ye tucked the fan into his pocket, patting it like a treasured item.</p> <p>Da Ming grinned foolishly.</p> <p>"Alright, lie back down now."</p> <p>Chen Ye laughed and scolded him gently. Da Ming took off his shirt and lay back on the bench, exposing his shoulder to Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye saw the long bruise on Da Ming&#8217;s skin and felt a pang in his heart.</p> <p>"Which damned bastard did this, so cruel?"</p> <p>Chen Ye cursed, pouring some Safflower Oil into his palm and quickly applying it to Da Ming&#8217;s bruise, rubbing it in bit by bit. Da Ming lay quietly on the bench, not making a sound.</p> <p>Outside the orphanage, a small head peeked in.</p> <p>She glanced around and was drawn to the scene in the courtyard.</p> <p>In the small courtyard with white walls and blue tiles, Da Ming lay shirtless on the bench while Chen Ye carefully applied safflower oil to his back.</p> <p>Da Ming&#8217;s tan back gleamed with the reddish-brown oil.</p> <p>Seeing this warm scene, Xiao Lian felt a soft spot in her heart being touched.</p> <p>She withdrew her head and leaned against the orphanage gate, staring at the clear blue sky in a daze.</p> <p>&#8216;Mom, maybe he isn&#8217;t a bad person after all?&#8217; {ED: Orphan 2 acquired!}</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"If I leave, you can't stop me."</p> <p>A young girl, dressed in a quaint blue dress, stood before Chen Ye, her lively demeanor contrasting against the solemn surroundings.</p> <p>"And... and you'll have to give me some money every month," she added after a moment of contemplation.</p> <p>"Alright, any other demands?" Chen Ye inquired, assessing the girl.</p> <p>The girl, with her fair complexion and delicate features, exuded an aura of innocence and refinement.</p> <p>"No other demands... for now," she replied after careful consideration, shaking her head.</p> <p>"You've stated all your demands, but I have one of my own," Chen Ye said with a faint smile.</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the girl became wary, her bright eyes darting towards Chen Ye. "What request?" she asked.</p> <p>"Do you have anyone else at home? This place is an orphanage, only for homeless children," Chen Ye explained, his gaze fixed on the girl.</p> <p>If the girl had run away from home, and her family reported it to the authorities, Chen Ye would be in trouble.</p> <p>With her eyes downcast and her hands clasped tightly together, the girl's voice trembled as she spoke, "My family... they're all dead."</p> <p>As she uttered these words, a hint of bitterness flashed in her eyes, revealing that things weren't as simple as she made them seem.</p> <p>Chen Ye's expression softened, and he decided not to probe further into her past.</p> <p>"Alright then, welcome to the orphanage..."</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Task: Adoption of the Second Orphan Completed!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations on receiving task completion rewards: 200 points, 20 taels of silver, one chance to draw a new orphan trait, and unlocking the construction of a new building: the Study Room&#12305;</p> <p>As the system's cold mechanical voice echoed in his ears, Chen Ye's smile widened.</p> <p>Just a while ago, this bright and clever girl had appeared outside the courtyard while he was tending to Da Ming, the wounded soldier.</p> <p>After expressing her intentions, they had engaged in the conversation just now.</p> <p>Based on her request for money, Chen Ye inferred that she didn't see herself as an orphan but rather as a maid in need of temporary shelter and some funds.</p> <p>"What's your name?"</p> <p>"Xiao Lian," the girl replied, her voice as crisp and clear as a mountain spring.</p> <p>A blue holographic screen appeared before Chen Ye.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Name: Xiao Lian&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;ID: 0002&#12305; {ED: Yup, definitely has Hitman vibes}</p> <p>&#12304;Gender: Female&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 13&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Skills: None&#12305;</p> <p>Surprised by her age, Chen Ye's expression changed slightly.</p> <p>Xiao Lian was even shorter than Da Ming, barely reaching a height of one meter and three centimeters.</p> <p>He hadn't expected her to be thirteen years old.</p> <p>In ancient times, a thirteen-year-old girl was considered eligible for marriage.</p> <p>&#8216;Could this girl have really run away from home?&#8217;</p> <p>In an instant, Chen Ye's mind conjured up various scenarios of rebellion under the feudal system.</p> <p>"How old are you this year?" Chen Ye suddenly asked.</p> <p>Xiao Lian raised her head slightly, met Chen Ye's gaze for a moment, then quickly averted her eyes, whispering, "Thirteen."</p> <p>&#8216;Not bad, she wasn't lying.&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed inwardly.</p> <p>He didn't dwell on it further; if her family came looking for her, he would deal with it then.</p> <p>After all, his task was to foster orphans. Once they entered the orphanage, they were his responsibility!</p> <p>"Alright, you'll sleep in the west room, me and Da Ming will sleep in the east room."</p> <p>"All the bedding and necessities are provided," Chen Ye explained the facilities and arrangements of the orphanage to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Xiao Lian listened attentively, her expression becoming increasingly peculiar as Chen Ye continued.</p> <p>With her arrival, the entire orphanage now housed only three people.</p> <p>Back in Jianning Prefecture, Xiao Lian recalled, the local orphanage used to accommodate over a dozen children. However, most of them were either physically disabled or mentally challenged like Da Ming.</p> <p>This small-scale orphanage was a first for her.</p> <p>After arranging Xiao Lian's accommodation, Chen Ye sat on a reclining chair, basking in the sun, and began to process his task rewards.</p> <p>After receiving the rewards, his points totaled 581, and he still had over 50 taels of silver, which was more than enough for his daily expenses.</p> <p>"System, draw an Orphan Skill," Chen Ye murmured as he lay on the chair, soaking in the sunlight.</p> <p>Instantly, a blue holographic roulette wheel appeared before his eyes, spinning rapidly.</p> <p>After a moment, it stopped on four words.</p> <p>&#12304;Great Wisdom Appears Foolish&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Skill Effect: Slightly increases intelligence, significantly improves insight; however, outwardly appears more honest and simple-minded&#12305;</p> <p>Upon seeing this label, Chen Ye sat up abruptly from his reclining chair.</p> <p>Da Ming, who had been squatting on the ground, observing ants, was startled by his sudden movement. Sniffling, he looked up at Chen Ye, confusion evident in his eyes.</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the skill label, his eyes shining with excitement.</p> <p>&#8216;This skill was perfect for Da Ming!&#8217; {ED: Not quite Idiot Savant but I&#8217;ll take it.}</p> <p>Without hesitation, Chen Ye bestowed the trait upon Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming, who had been sniffling, suddenly froze. His previously vacant gaze slowly transformed into one of further simplicity.</p> <p>He rubbed his head, feeling an indescribable sensation.</p> <p>Da Ming felt like his mind had cleared up a bit. Things he didn't understand before, he now understood.</p> <p>After giving the skill, Chen Ye looked at Da Ming and his mouth twitched.</p> <p>Why did he seem even more braindead now...?</p> <p>Initially, Da Ming had appeared slow-witted and slow to react, but now, compared to before, he exuded an air of simplicity.</p> <p>In summary, he looked foolish. {ED: Damn, Author. Do you have a grudge against Da Ming? xD}</p> <p>Chen Ye observed Da Ming intently.</p> <p>Da Ming stood up and gave Chen Ye a simple smile. "Dad."</p> <p>"Hmm, it seems to have some effect," Chen Ye stroked his chin, pondering.</p> <p>If one looked closely, they would notice that Da Ming's eyes seemed brighter than before.</p> <p>Just like the description on the trait label: Great Wisdom Appears Foolish.</p> <p>With this skill, at least it compensated for Da Ming's intellectual shortcomings. It was okay for him to look a bit foolish; after all, he was originally quite ordinary.</p> <p>After drawing the skill, Chen Ye glanced at the newly unlocked Study Room function.</p> <p>&#12304;Please select the binding location for the Study Room&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;After binding, the building will transform into a Study, gaining the Study Room buff&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Study Room buff: Reading in the Study Room greatly enhances insight and memory&#12305;</p> <p>Chen Ye examined the layout of the courtyard and decided to bind the Study to the west wing room.</p> <p>The west wing room faced east, so when the sun rose, the first rays of sunlight would shine through the windows into the Study.</p> <p>By then, the children in the orphanage would be seated neatly in the Study, with the sound of pages turning filling the air.</p> <p>How wonderful that would be.</p> <p>Chen Ye closed his eyes and imagined the scene, but then he felt something was amiss.</p> <p>When there were more children later on, they would inevitably need to learn academic knowledge, right?</p> <p>Who would teach them then?</p> <p>With that thought, Chen Ye sighed lightly.</p> <p>Raising orphans was indeed not as simple as it seemed...</p> <p>There were many aspects to consider.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Xiao Lian sat in her room, which was not large, with several empty beds inside.</p> <p>It seemed that when there were more children in the orphanage, they would inevitably have to squeeze into one room.</p> <p>However, Xiao Lian was not picky about it; this was typical for most ordinary households anyway.</p> <p>She looked out through the window and saw Chen Ye occasionally sitting up from his reclining chair and Da Ming squatting beside him, watching the ants. She stared blankly for a moment.</p> <p>Then, she took out the book she had obtained from the unkempt man.</p> <p>The book had a purple cover that was somewhat yellowed, and the words "Jing Hua Techniques" on the cover were a bit worn, indicating that the original owner must have frequently perused it.</p> <p>As her gaze moved inch by inch over the cover, Xiao Lian closed her eyes and silently vowed, "Mother, I will kill him.&#8221;</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>As the sun sets behind the western mountains, leaving behind a lingering tinge of orange-red in the sky, wisps of smoke rise from the chimneys of Yuhang County. The air carries a faint aroma of cooking, drifting lazily amidst the evening breeze.</p> <p>"This is called MSG. Adding a bit of it while cooking will enhance the flavour," Chen Ye instructed as he stood by the stove, a pot of vegetables sizzling in front of him.</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood beside Chen Ye, listening intently.</p> <p>Next to the stove were various jars and bottles, each containing different seasonings. Chen Ye patiently explained to Xiao Lian, one by one, which seasoning was which.</p> <p>In the afternoon, Chen Ye granted Xiao Lian the &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305; skill. He was a bit hesitant, fearing that one day Xiao Lian might run away after receiving the trait.</p> <p>However, after consulting the system, Chen Ye learned that If any orphan left the orphanage, he could reclaim the traits he had given them.</p> <p>With the system's assurance, Chen Ye felt relieved and decisively bestowed the &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305; skill upon Xiao Lian.</p> <p>By dusk, as smoke rose from every household signalling the start of dinner preparations, Chen Ye began teaching Xiao Lian how to cook, step by step.</p> <p>Xiao Lian listened attentively, noticing that Chen Ye's cooking methods were somewhat unconventional.</p> <p>In particular, he used many strange and unique seasonings. Gradually, a dish was prepared, its colour enticing and its aroma delightful.</p> <p>Chen Ye handed her a pair of chopsticks. Xiao Lian took a bite and was instantly amazed by the extraordinary taste.</p> <p>"Director, this... this is incredibly delicious!" she exclaimed.</p> <p>"Why don't you open a restaurant? You'd have so many customers."</p> <p>Xiao Lian hesitated, unsure how to address Chen Ye. She couldn't very well call him "Dad" like Da Ming did...</p> <p>Chen Ye noticed her hesitation and told her it was fine to call him "Director"</p> <p>Hearing her suggestion, Chen Ye chuckles softly. "Opening a restaurant might indeed bring in a lot of money. But running an orphanage, I gain something that money can't buy."</p> <p>Hearing this, Xiao Lian's bright, watery eyes widened, and she gave Chen Ye a deep look, as if something inside her was touched. {ED: Can't wait for this misunderstanding to never be corrected. But hey, whatever advances the plot, right?}</p> <p>Chen Ye wasn't lying; he was telling the truth. Running the orphanage meant receiving rewards from the system, rewards money couldn't buy. Moreover, there was a monthly limit on redeeming items from the system's shop.</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't trade points for items and then sell those items for silver coins. Points were far more valuable than money.</p> <p>After cooking a dish, Chen Ye handed the spatula to Xiao Lian and watched her work. She learned quickly, likely due to the influence of the &#12304;Dexterous Hands&#12305; skill.</p> <p>Before long, she had stir-fried a dish that was visually appealing and fragrant.</p> <p>When dinner was ready, Xiao Lian prepared to eat in the kitchen, but Chen Ye stopped her.</p> <p>"You and Da Ming are both children in my eyes. Let's eat together," Chen Ye said in a calm tone, making Xiao Lian momentarily lost in thought.</p> <p>In the Da Wu Dynasty, much like the feudal dynasties in history, men were considered superior to women, and women were not allowed to eat at the table. However, Chen Ye, being a modern man, found these old customs outdated and awkward.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, at thirteen, was just a child in his eyes.</p> <p>At the dinner table, Xiao Lian initially ate with the restraint of a proper lady. However, after a few bites, her cheeks turned slightly red, and her bright eyes sparkled as she couldn't resist taking more food.</p> <p>With the help of modern seasonings, no one could resist such delicious flavours.</p> <p>By the end of the meal, Xiao Lian's small belly was round from eating, and her pretty face was flushed with embarrassment. Da MIng was even burping contentedly, grinning foolishly.</p> <p>After dinner, Chen Ye took Da MIng to the study to read "Water Margin" picture books and learn characters.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, carrying an oil lamp, returned to her own room.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Outside Yuhang County.</p> <p>The sun hung low on the horizon, and the sky was growing dark.</p> <p>By the roadside, a banner with the words "Tea House" fluttered in the wind, hanging from a tall pole. Next to the pole was a small tea house with four or five long benches and three tables inside.</p> <p>At this moment, an old man in coarse clothing was tidying up the teacups, using the last light of the setting sun.</p> <p>Hunched over, with cloudy eyes, he poured the leftover tea onto the ground and stacked the cups together.</p> <p>Suddenly, a figure appeared on the main road.</p> <p>This person wasn't on horseback but was running swiftly on foot.</p> <p>The old man glanced indifferently with the corner of his eye and continued to tremulously carry the cups into the back kitchen.</p> <p>The figure sprinted forward, leaping several times, and quickly arrived at the tea house.</p> <p>It was a young man, with an ordinary appearance and simple clothing, but his eyes were sharp and sinister.</p> <p>Upon reaching the tea house, the man didn't sit down. Instead, he respectfully clasped his fists and called out towards the back kitchen, "Subordinate Shi Shisan greets the Executor."</p> <p>A slightly hoarse voice responded from within, "Have you gathered another batch of children?"</p> <p>As he spoke, the old man in coarse clothes emerged from the back kitchen, his back now straight, his entire demeanour changed.</p> <p>His once-cloudy eyes had turned pitch black, exuding a chilling aura.</p> <p>Seeing the Executor emerge, Shi Shisan knelt down, "This subordinate has failed the mission. Please punish me, Executor."</p> <p>The old man glanced at him, his pitch-black eyes cold and penetrating, "What happened?"</p> <p>"Such a small task, don't tell me you messed it up."</p> <p>Feeling the coldness in the old man's tone, Shi Shisan couldn't help but tremble.</p> <p>He gritted his teeth and said, "Executor, I encountered... a highly skilled martial artist."</p> <p>"He claimed I had abducted his disciple..."</p> <p>Shi Shisan recounted the events to the old man.</p> <p>After hearing the story, the old man's sparse brows furrowed deeply.</p> <p>"You said you struck him square in the chest with your Yu Luo Leg Technique, infused with eighty percent for your internal energy, but it sounded like striking metal?"</p> <p>"Yes!" Shi Shisan replied, still kneeling on the ground.</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the steward's expression darkened even further.</p> <p>"He's a master of Heng Lian cultivation. After taking your blow unscathed, he should be at least second-grade," the old man mused for a moment.</p> <p>"Don't go to Yuhang County for the time being."</p> <p>"Yes!"</p> <p>As if suddenly remembering something, the old man asks, "What about Shi Liu?"</p> <p>Shi Shisan's face instantly reveals a look of embarrassment as he hesitantly says, "Shi Liu... Shi Liu was captured by the authorities."</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the old man visibly paused for a moment, then took a deep breath.</p> <p>'Useless.'</p> <p>"Enough of this matter. Go back and exchange for the third-level martial art."</p> <p>Shi Shisan's face lit up with joy as he kowtowed.</p> <p>"Thank you, Executor!"</p> <p>The rough-dressed old man remained silent, his gaze fixed on the north, his eyes deep.</p> <p>On a summer night, a slightly cool breeze blew in, lifting the old man's robe. The trees beside the road swayed, their leaves rustling. The sky quickly darkened, and a distant horizon added a layer of clouds.</p> <p>Low-pressure clouds gathered together, emitting a deep thunder. Torrential rain poured down in an instant.</p> <p>Song Cangjie removed his hat and looked at the darkening sky, feeling fortunate.</p> <p>He stood in front of a residence and knocked on the door.</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Knock, knock</del></p> <p>The door opened from inside, and a bearded man looked at Song Cangjie, his face showing joy.</p> <p>"Jie Di, you've finally come."</p> <p>Seeing the man, Song Cangjie's dark face broke into a smile.</p> <p>"Elder Brother!"</p> <p>"Come in quickly. There's no need for formalities between us brothers."</p> <p>Qi Penglong pulled Song Cangjie into the house.</p> <p>Song Cangjie sat on a chair, smiling. He took out a bamboo tube from his pocket and placed it on the table.</p> <p>"Elder Brother, here are the Thousand Mile Incense and Xun Xiang Feng."</p> <p>Qi Penglong quickly waves his hand, pushing the bamboo tube back. "Jie Di, you know what this is. The Liu Shan Men don't lack these."</p> <p>"When I borrowed it from you, I didn't intend to take it back. Now that your martial arts have declined, and if there are no other means to handle the case, it might be difficult," Qi Penglong said, with a hint of pity.</p> <p>A trace of loneliness and unwillingness flickered on Song Cangjie's face, but he quickly covered it up.</p> <p>Qi Penglong slapped his forehead, realising that he inadvertently touched his brother's emotional scar again. He quickly changed the subject.</p> <p>"Jie Di, I've just acquired a batch of good wine recently. Tonight, we won't return until we're drunk."</p> <p>Song Cangjie laughed heartily, "Then I'll have to accompany you, elder brother!"</p> <p>Qi Penglong went into the inner room, took out two jars of wine, and brought out several plates of appetisers. The two brothers then ate and drank together.</p> <p>As they ate and drank, Song Cangjie's face showed a difficult expression.</p> <p>"Here's the thing. The missing children are in the private possession of Liu Magistrate."</p> <p>"That mansion burned down, and we caught a survivor. He's severely burned, and whether he can survive is uncertain."</p> <p>"If it's found out to be related to Magistrate Liu, things will be difficult."</p> <p>Qi Penglong silently picked up his wine bowl, taking small sips as the liquid dripped onto his beard.</p> <p>After Song Cangjie finished speaking, Qi Penglong narrowed his eyes, a cold light flashing in them.</p> <p>He sneered, "A petty county magistrate getting involved with the people from Fengyu Tower---he won't even know how he ends up dead."</p> <p>As he spoke, Qi Penglong looked at Song Cangjie and saw the worried expression on his face, feeling both frustrated and sympathetic.</p> <p>Nowadays, even a petty county magistrate could trouble Song Cangjie...</p> <p>"Leave this matter to me. Tomorrow, I'll have someone write up an official document for you to take back."</p> <p>Song Cangjie filled Qi Penglong's cup with wine, raised his own, and drank it in one go. "Thank you, brother!"</p> <p>"No need for such formality between us. Now, tell me more about this mysterious master you encountered."</p> <p>Mentioning the man in black, Song Cangjie immediately became excited, his eyes lighting up. "That senior appeared ordinary, but when the bronze-ranked assassin from Fengyu Tower struck his chest with a kick infused with eighty percent of the internal energy that should be available to him, yet it sounded like metal hitting metal."</p> <p>After Song Cangjie finished recounting the event, Qi Penglong frowned in disbelief. "Could it be the Thirteen Guardians' Iron Body technique?"</p> <p>"No, the senior looked normal. I think it might be the Golden Bell Cover or the Iron Shirt." Song Cangjie speculated as he picked up a piece of food with his chopsticks.</p> <p>"Although the bronze-ranked assassin is only fourth rank, to easily withstand that strike, he must be at least second rank."</p> <p>"And considering the metallic sound you heard, his external training technique must be at an advanced level!"</p> <p>Qi Penglong's expression turned to one of surprise. "That senior's strength is probably on par with the three head officers."</p> <p>The Liu Shan Men organisation had three head officers, all first-rank experts, renowned in the martial world.</p> <p>"However, it's unlikely he's a grandmaster. There are fewer than five grandmasters in the martial world, and they are elusive."</p> <p>"A grandmaster hiding in a small place like Yuhang County... seems improbable." Qi Penglong took a sip of wine and shook his head. "Not likely."</p> <p>Hearing Qi Penglong's analysis, Song Cangjie nodded in agreement.</p> <p>Thinking about it, a grandmaster was indeed unlikely. Each grandmaster was a legendary figure in the martial world.</p> <p>As for a grandmaster known for external training, Song Cangjie had never heard of one.</p> <p>Seeing Song Cangjie deep in thought with his chopsticks in hand, Qi Penglong poured more wine and said, "Drink more with me, brother. In a few days, you might not be able to see me."</p> <p>Song Cangjie snapped out of his thoughts and asked with a smile, "Why? Is there something happening in the organisation?"</p> <p>Qi Penglong took a big gulp of his wine.</p> <p>"Tang Feng, a true disciple of Tang Sect, stole the secret scroll for the Dragon Whisker Needles and fled from Sichuan to Shaoxing Prefecture, committing crimes along the way. He's drawn the ire of many righteous sects."</p> <p>"Several true disciples from the Jiangnan Thunder Hall plan to join forces to kill him and seize the manual. If Thunder Hall gets their hands on the Dragon Whisker Needles scroll, Tang Sect will be furious."</p> <p>Hearing this, Song Cangjie was shocked. "Tang Feng? Didn't he just reach second rank earlier this year?"</p> <p>"The true disciples of Thunder Hall have been in second rank for years, all in the mid-stage. If they join forces, Tang Feng is doomed."</p> <p>Qi Penglong nodded. "And a few gold-ranked assassins from Fengyu Tower are also eyeing the manual."</p> <p>"But he's been in Shaoxing Prefecture these past few days. Liu Shan Men wants to prevent large-scale bloodshed, so I'll be busy from tomorrow onwards."</p> <p>Song Cangjie filled Qi Penglong's cup with wine.</p> <p>Outside, the rumbling of thunder grew louder, accompanied by the increasing sound of raindrops hitting the ground.</p> <p>Qi Penglong glanced at the darkening sky outside and said, "Brother, stay here with me tonight."</p> <p>"Tomorrow, I'll prepare the official document from Liu Shan Men for you, ensuring that the county magistrate won't dare say anything."</p> <p>"Thank you, brother!"</p> <p>Song Cangjie raised his cup and clinked it with Qi Penglong's.</p> <p>Boom~ Boom~</p> <p>The thunder rolled, and the rain outside grew heavier.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>It was nearing midnight, and Chen Ye lay in bed, the cold mechanical sound of the system ringing in his ears.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Daily Settlement:&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Today, Chen Da Ming woke up early to fetch water, training his strength, earning 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You noticed Da Ming waking up early to work, felt sorry for him, and told him to go back to sleep, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You took Da Ming to the morning market for wontons, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming broke a porcelain bowl, training his strength, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming ate too much, earning 5 points.&#12305; {ED:Lol}</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming was captured by Fengyu Tower, broke down the prison door, and escaped, earning 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming reunited with you, earning 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;As a token of gratitude, Chen Da Ming gave you a pink round fan, earning 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You applied medicine for Chen Da Ming, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You granted Chen Da Ming the attribute "Great Wisdom Appears Foolish," making him smarter, earning 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming ate too much at dinner, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You took Chen Da Ming to read "Water Margin," teaching him literacy, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You taught Chen Da Ming personal hygiene, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You adopted a second orphan: Xiao Lian, earning 200 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You taught Xiao Lian how to use seasonings, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian learned cooking methods, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian watched the manual &#8220;Jing Hua Zhi" and had some insights, earning 20 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming's gratitude towards you has increased!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Total points: 350&#12305;</p> <p>Daily settlement is complete, and Chen Ye's total points have reached 931.</p> <p>Then, the system displayed Chen Da Ming's information box.</p> <p>&#12304;Name: Chen Da Ming&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;ID: 0001&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Gender: Male&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 10&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Skills: Strong Physique, Great Wisdom Appears Foolish&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current Gratitude: 65%&#12305;</p> <p>Seeing the gratitude level increase by 5%, Chen Ye smiled.</p> <p>&#8216;This kid Da Ming, although a bit silly, is indeed a good child.&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye pulled up the daily settlement again, carefully examining Xiao Lian's part.</p> <p>"Xiao Lian actually has a scroll? Where did she get it from?"</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered, becoming more curious about Xiao Lian's background.</p> <p>"Are the actions she took before being adopted not counted in the daily settlement?"</p> <p>After dealing with the settlement information, he checked the task updates.</p> <p>&#12304;Task: Establish future career development direction for orphans (0/2)&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Task Reward: 1000 points, chance to draw Orphan Skill *2&#12305;</p> <p>Chen Ye rubbed his chin, considering the difficulty of the task.</p> <p>"This task is a bit challenging, hmm..."</p> <p>"Well, I'll think about it later. Time for bed."</p> <p>Putting aside the thoughts in his mind, Chen Ye drifted off to sleep.</p> <p>Some time passed.</p> <p>Cock-a-doodle-doo~</p> <p>Cock-a-doodle-doo~</p> <p>The continuous crowing of roosters echoed through the city of Yuhang once again.</p> <p>"Here we go again!"</p> <p>Chen Ye, showing a reluctant expression, wriggled in bed for a moment, then listened to the faint movements in the courtyard, widening his eyes.</p> <p>"Da Ming?" Chen Ye called out.</p> <p>From the nearby small bed came the innocent voice, "Dad?"</p> <p>&#8216;Is it not Da Ming?&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye listened closely and indeed heard the faint sound of something rubbing in the courtyard.</p> <p>It sounded like...</p> <p>The sound of sweeping.</p> <p>&#8216;No way, another early riser?&#8217;</p> <p>Chen Ye got out of bed, put on his clothes, and went out to the courtyard.</p> <p>There he saw Xiao Lian, dressed in a light blue dress, holding a broom in her delicate hands, sweeping the ground.</p> <p>A thin mist enveloped the air, and the sound of sweeping echoed with a rustle. A faint dust cloud rose from the ground.</p> <p>Hearing movement behind her, Xiao Lian turned to look at Chen Ye, a bright smile on her pretty little face as she crisply greeted, &#8220;Director."</p> <p>The young girl's hair was styled in a traditional maiden's bun, her figure slender, adding a touch of ancient beauty in the hazy mist.</p> <p>Chen Ye was momentarily stunned, then regained his senses, somewhat puzzled. "Xiao Lian, what are you..."</p> <p>"Sweeping the courtyard. Master Zhu said: 'Rise at dawn, sweep the courtyard, keep it clean inside and out.'"</p> <p>Xiao Lian held the broom, explaining as she swept, "I've already heated up breakfast. It'll be ready in a while."</p> <p>At these words, Chen Ye couldn't help but twitch his mouth a couple of times. He couldn't help feeling a twinge of guilt.</p> <p>Ancient people used to rise early, unlike him, who kept sleeping until the sun shone on his buttocks.</p> <p>Chen Ye opened his mouth, wanting to tell Xiao Lian to stop and go back to rest, but seeing that Xiao Lian was almost done sweeping and breakfast was almost ready, he couldn't bring himself to say it.</p> <p>Ah...</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed inwardly.</p> <p>What a torment.</p> <p>Get up, get up.</p> <p>Chen Ye turned to go back to his room to change clothes. Suddenly, he paused, turned back, and asked, "Xiao Lian, have you... been to a private school?"</p> <p>"No... just learned... learned a bit from... from my family."</p> <p>The girl's clear voice came through.</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded at her response, finding Xiao Lian's background somewhat intriguing.</p> <p>Ordinary commoners wouldn't have access to things like "Master Zhu's sayings."</p> <p>Chen Ye pushed the door and went back into the room.</p> <p>Unseen by him, Xiao Lian tightly gripped the broom, blue veins bulging on her fair little hand.</p> <p>A few seconds later, Xiao Lian continued to sweep the courtyard, keeping it clean.</p> <p>...</p> <p>"Come on, Da Ming, follow my rhythm, one-two-three-four, two-two-three-four, three-two-three-four, four-two-three-four, let's do it again..."</p> <p>"Good, next is chest expansion exercise, one-two-three-four..."</p> <p>Chen Ye led Da Ming in doing radio exercises in the middle of the courtyard.</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood on the side, watching the odd yet somewhat graceful movements of the two, a look of wanting to laugh but restraining herself.</p> <p>Chen Ye noticed Xiao Lian and invited her, "Xiao Lian, do you want to join us in the radio exercises?"</p> <p>Blushing, Xiao Lian shook her head and quickly retreated into the study.</p> <p>These strange movements didn't look like martial arts at all, and she didn't want to learn.</p> <p>It was no use.</p> <p>Chen Ye did the exercises with Da Ming a few times, sweating all over. In the slightly chilly morning, steam rose from his body.</p> <p>"Da Ming, from now on, do this twice every morning. You got a lot of the moves wrong just now."</p> <p>Chen Ye patted Da Ming's shoulder, smiling.</p> <p>Da Ming smiled foolishly, silent.</p> <p>He didn't think the moves just now were bad at all; on the contrary, he found them quite fun.</p> <p>Chen Ye's purpose in doing radio exercises with Da Ming was actually quite profound. He found that the daily settlement points were mainly from exercises. Doing exercises with the children every day increased interaction, resulting in more points during settlement.</p> <p>Chen Ye stretched his body a few times and admonished Da Ming, "Da Ming, exercise more when you have free time."</p> <p>"When you're hungry, we'll eat. Director has money, so don't worry about eating."</p> <p>With Da Ming's &#12304;Strong Physique&#12305;skill, the more he exercised, the better.</p> <p>Chen Ye also checked Da Ming's shoulder injury again, seeing that the bruising had faded considerably from yesterday, he finally felt relieved.</p> <p>Through yesterday's daily settlement, Chen Ye learned that the injury was from Da Ming bumping into the cell door.</p> <p>Presumably, the people at the Fengyu Tower placed the children temporarily in the house, considering their age and strength, the cell door shouldn't have been too sturdy.</p> <p>That Da Ming could come back this time was also considered lucky.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>After breakfast, Xiao Lian washed the dishes and walked out of the kitchen, saying, "We're almost out of firewood. We need to buy some."</p> <p>Her bright eyes fixed on Chen Ye, implying that money was needed.</p> <p>Chen Ye understood Xiao Lian's meaning. After a moment of thought, he said, "I'll go. I'll also buy some benches and oil lamps. The study room needs some things."</p> <p>He paused and added, "You should come too. I can advance you half of your wages. If there's anything you like or need, you can buy it yourself."</p> <p>Xiao Lian's eyes sparkled with delight upon hearing this.</p> <p>Yesterday, Chen Ye and Xiao Lian had agreed on a monthly wage of four taels of silver, equivalent to about two thousand yuan in modern terms (please refer to the book for specifics on silver currency in this fictional world).</p> <p>Perhaps in Xiao Lian's eyes, joining the orphanage meant becoming a maid.</p> <p>But to Chen Ye, she was just an orphan. Giving her a monthly wage was entirely to respect her dignity.</p> <p>"Th... Thank you, Director."</p> <p>Xiao Lian expressed her gratitude gracefully.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the little girl, as delicate as a fine jade, and smiled slightly. Since Xiao Lian arrived yesterday, she had eagerly taken on various household chores.</p> <p>It was clear that Xiao Lian was a good child.</p> <p>"Da Ming?"</p> <p>Chen Ye called out.</p> <p>Da Ming, who was practicing with a bench in the courtyard, responded clumsily, "Dad!"</p> <p>"Continue practicing after we return. Let's go buy some things first."</p> <p>Da Ming put down the bench and ran to Chen Ye's side, looking ready to go.</p> <p>After locking the door, the three of them went to the market together.</p> <p>The streets were bustling with people. On either side of the street, various small vendors had set up stalls, and the sounds of hawking filled the air.</p> <p>Da Ming and Xiao Lian each held a skewer of candied haws.</p> <p>Da Ming took big bites, a silly smile on his face.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, on the other hand, ate much more gracefully, taking small bites with her white teeth nibbling on the bright red hawthorn, her fair face showing a hint of joy.</p> <p>Although Xiao Lian usually acted very mature, she was still a child at heart.</p> <p>Seeing this scene, Chen Ye's lips curved into a slight smile.</p> <p>As they were walking, Chen Ye suddenly heard someone calling him from behind.</p> <p>"You there, young man..."</p> <p>Chen Ye stopped, and Da Ming and Xiao Lian turned around together.</p> <p>Upon seeing the person, Xiao Lian's pupils contracted slightly, and her expression became somewhat uneasy.</p> <p>A black-faced man, dressed in black clothes with a long knife at his waist, stood authoritatively in front of the three of them.</p> <p>Captain Song?</p> <p>Seeing that it was Song Cangjie who stopped him, Chen Ye was a bit surprised.</p> <p>I was dressed so thoroughly that day, and my voice was different too. Could he still recognize me?</p> <p>"Captain Song, is there something you need?"</p> <p>Chen Ye suppressed his doubts and asked calmly.</p> <p>Song Cangjie glanced at Chen Ye, then looked at the two children beside him, a hint of disappointment flashing in his eyes.</p> <p>With a strong voice, he said, "No, I thought I recognized you from behind and mistook you for an old acquaintance."</p> <p>"Sorry to bother you."</p> <p>Song Cangjie clasped his fists and turned to leave.</p> <p>'Recognized from the back...You can tell just from that?'</p> <p>Chen Ye inwardly scoffed. Seeing Song Cangjie leave, he stopped thinking about it and continued shopping with the two kids.</p> <p>"Brother Song, did you know that person just now?"</p> <p>The group of officers, seeing Song Cangjie return, quickly asked.</p> <p>Song Cangjie shook his head, "I was mistaken, no worries."</p> <p>"What happened yesterday?"</p> <p>The officer with small eyes said, "Yesterday, we questioned the children who were abducted and pieced together a rough account of the events."</p> <p>"According to the children, there was another guard in the room, but that guard got drunk and fell asleep."</p> <p>"Then a fool kept ramming the prison door, breaking the wood, and they all ran out."</p> <p>"As for why the fire started, they don't know either."</p> <p>The tall and thin officer added, "The prison door the children mentioned was actually a wooden fence door."</p> <p>"The wood was as thick as a bowl. If a strong person rammed it a few times, it would break open."</p> <p>After hearing the account, Song Cangjie nodded, "The one who broke open the door must be the disciple of that senior."</p> <p>"It seems the child has been practicing martial arts from a young age."</p> <p>The other officers agreed.</p> <p>Thinking back to the senior from yesterday, the officers still felt a deep sense of gratitude.</p> <p>Thanks to that senior, they were able to return home to their families safe and sound, otherwise, they would likely have ended up dead under the enemies' blades.</p> <p>"By the way, Brother Song, the private residence of Magistrate Liu caught fire, and he's furious, blaming us for it."</p> <p>The officer with small eyes had a worried look, his eyes frequently glancing at Song Cangjie as he spoke.</p> <p>Before taking action, Song Cangjie had assured them he could handle this.</p> <p>A faint smile appeared on Song Cangjie's dark face, "I'll go see Magistrate Liu."</p> <p>"This is nothing."</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the other constables beamed with joy.</p> <p>"I told you, Brother Song has connections in the Liu Shan Men Sect!"</p> <p>"Hehe, Brother Song, let us treat you to drinks tonight."</p> <p>The officers quickly headed towards the justice hall.</p> <p>Walking along the street, Chen Ye muttered to himself, "A martial artist of the lowest tier almost recognized me."</p> <p>"If it's a higher-tier martial artist, would they recognize me at a glance?"</p> <p>Thinking about this, Chen Ye's heart burned with excitement.</p> <p>Yesterday, upon learning that there were indeed sects in this world where one could practice martial arts, Chen Ye had been thrilled for a long time.</p> <p>He had always fantasized about wearing white robes, wielding a fine sword, and roaming the martial world on horseback. {ED: Don't we all...}</p> <p>Now that this fantasy could become a reality, Chen Ye's dream of becoming a hero was reignited.</p> <p>Where are those sects located, and what are their requirements for accepting disciples?</p> <p>'There doesn't seem to be a martial arts school in Yuhang County...'</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered as he walked.</p> <p>In Yuhang County, a constable was a martial artist of the lowest tier.</p> <p>Given this ratio, it seemed that the number of martial artists wasn't very high.</p> <p>Suddenly, Chen Ye looked at Xiao Lian beside him and asked, "Xiao Lian, what are the levels of martial artists?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian paused, blinked her eyes, and looked up with a puzzled expression, "Levels?"</p> <p>"What levels?"</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at Xiao Lian for a moment, feeling that she didn't seem to be lying, and shook his head, "Never mind."</p> <p>Xiao Lian was completely puzzled, not understanding why Chen Ye had suddenly asked about martial arts levels.</p> <p>After walking for a while, the three arrived in front of a courtyard. From within came the constant sound of chopping and splitting.</p> <p>A burly man with a robust build was shirtless, wielding an axe. He lifted it high above his head and brought it down heavily.</p> <p>The log on the chopping block split in two with a crisp crack.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye, the man paused and asked with a smile, "Here to buy firewood?"</p> <p>"Give me some."</p> <p>Chen Ye stepped into the courtyard, with Da Ming following closely behind. When Da Ming saw the glinting axe and the split wood, his eyes widened.</p> <p>He even stopped eating the half-finished sugar-coated hawthorn in his hand.</p> <p>He stared intently at the axe and the split wood.</p> <p>After Chen Ye negotiated the price with the man, he turned around to see Da Ming squatting by the chopping block, holding the axe.</p> <p>Da Ming, gripping the axe, called out to Chen Ye, "Dad!"</p> <p>"Dad!"</p> <p>He called out several times in a row.</p> <p>The man carrying a bundle of firewood saw Da Ming holding up the axe and couldn't help but laugh, "Young man has some serious strength."</p> <p>"In a few more years, he'll be even stronger. He'll probably be able to do any kind of work."</p> <p>The man looked at Da Ming with a hint of envy. He had two daughters but no son, and it had always been his dream to have a son. A strong son like Da Ming.</p> <p>Chen Ye squatted down, patted Da Ming's head, and said, "What's up?"</p> <p>"Calling me so affectionately---do you want this axe?"</p> <p>Da Ming nodded vigorously, his eyes glued to the axe in his hands.</p> <p>Chen Ye found it curious why Da Ming was so interested in the axe.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, standing nearby, thought for a moment and came up with a possible explanation. Perhaps Da Ming liked the axe because it could easily split wood, unlike the way he had to break things by force yesterday.</p> <p>Xiao Lian blinked her lively eyes. It was just a guess and might not be accurate.</p> <p>The man placed the bundle of firewood down and said with a smile, "If the young man likes it, I have a smaller axe at home. I can give it to him."</p> <p>He went into the woodshed and brought out a slightly smaller axe. It looked a bit old but was still usable.</p> <p>Da Ming looked up, holding the axe tightly, and called out again, "Dad."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled, stood up, took out some copper coins from his pocket, and added a bit extra to cover both the firewood and the axe.</p> <p>"Chen Gongzi, this is too much..."</p> <p>The man wanted to decline, but Chen Ye wasn't the type to accept favours without reciprocation.</p> <p>After paying for the small axe, Da Ming now had a small axe that was just the right size for him.</p> <p>Da Ming held the small axe, his honest face beaming with excitement.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Mission progress update: 1/2]</p> <p>A cold mechanical voice sounded in Chen Ye's ear.</p> <p>A translucent blue screen appeared in front of him.</p> <p>Seeing that the mission progress was half complete, Chen Ye's expression was quite remarkable.</p> <p>"This counts as establishing a future career direction?"</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>In the height of summer, the weather grew hotter with each passing day. The incessant chirping of cicadas filled the air, adding to the sweltering heat. Under the blazing sun, the air seemed to shimmer visibly with rising heat waves.</p> <p>Sitting in the shade of a tree, Chen Ye fanned himself with a pink round fan, yet sweat still poured down his forehead.</p> <p>Located in the southern part of the Great Wu Dynasty, Lin'an Prefecture experienced bone-chilling winters and scorching summers.</p> <p>"System, what were you thinking, choosing this place? It's nothing compared to the north," Chen Ye complained while fanning himself.</p> <p>The system, being non-conscious, couldn't respond.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed since Chen Ye arrived in the Great Wu Dynasty.</p> <p>He gradually adjusted to the ancient lifestyle, including its rhythms and customs.</p> <p>Through daily settlements, Chen Ye's accumulation of points reached 4092.</p> <p>The average daily gain or loss fluctuated around 100 points.</p> <p>In addition, Chen Ye became acquainted with his neighbors.</p> <p>They knew about the newly established "Yuhang Orphanage," led by a young man who was kind-hearted and always willing to help, often seen assisting others with their children.</p> <p>Among these neighbors was the madam from the Yi Hong Brothel.</p> <p>One morning, the madam from the Yi Hong Brothel paid Chen Ye a visit, bringing some gifts and engaging in a conversation.</p> <p>The details of their conversation were unclear, but when she left, the madam's face bore a smile, and Chen Ye's treasury gained an additional 100 taels of silver.</p> <p>That night, as Chen Ye slept soundly, he heard the cries of a baby outside his door. He went out and found a baby girl, whom he named Chen An'an, nicknamed Xiaofu.</p> <p>Thus began Chen Ye and Xiao Lian's challenging life.</p> <p>Xiaofu was lively by nature and liked to cry and make a scene to attract attention. Whenever she was awake and there was no one around, she would start wailing.</p> <p>With no other choice, Chen Ye and Xiao Lian took turns caring for Xiaofu each day.</p> <p>Fortunately, Xiaofu was already a year old and had been weaned, otherwise Chen Ye would have had to find a wet nurse.</p> <p>"Waaah..."</p> <p>In the orphanage, the cries of Xiaofu could be heard again, and Chen Ye's face relaxed.</p> <p>Today was Xiao Lian's turn to take care of Xiaofu, so he could have a peaceful day. However, tomorrow would be his turn again.</p> <p>Thinking about this, Chen Ye's face showed signs of distress. Adopting and caring for an orphan was not an easy task. Fortunately, for now, there was only Xiaofu, but as the orphanage grew, it would require more manpower.</p> <p>Recently, officials from the justice hall had also visited and brought some silver.</p> <p>Their implication was clear: the orphanage was a good deed, and if there were any unwanted children in the future, the yamen (the headquarters or residence of a Chinese government) would send them here. After all, in ancient times, in families with poor conditions, many chose to drown their female babies.</p> <p>In a way, the orphanage was accumulating virtue.</p> <p>The children adopted by the orphanage could be registered and recorded in the household registry, avoiding the issue of unregistered individuals.</p> <p>Therefore, in terms of finances, Chen Ye didn't have to worry. As long as there weren't too many people, it would be enough to cover living expenses.</p> <p>Da Ming's physique had visibly improved over the past month, and he was taller than children of the same age. However, his appetite had also increased day by day.</p> <p>Chen Ye would tremble at the words "Dad, I'm hungry."</p> <p>At the dining table, Chen Ye worried that Da Ming would burst his stomach with the amount of food he ate.</p> <p>Fortunately, such fantasies did not come true.</p> <p>Furthermore, Chen Ye noticed that Da Ming was particularly fond of axes. In the first few days after receiving the axe, he would swing it around every day, even sleeping with it. Concerned that he might accidentally injure someone, Chen Ye drilled a hole in the axe handle and tied a rope to it so Da Ming could carry it on his waist when not in use.</p> <p>Apart from his love for axes, Da Ming seemed to have an inherent aversion to wood. Every time firewood was brought home, Da Ming would insist on chopping it with his small axe as if venting his frustrations.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't delve into the reasons behind this behaviour.</p> <p>In a month's time, Da Ming's gratitude level had risen to 79%, and it was expected to reach 80% within a day or two.</p> <p>It was clear that Da Ming was very satisfied with his current life and grateful to Chen Ye.</p> <p>Considering Da Ming's attributes, Chen Ye purchased a "Schwarzenegger Exercise Manual" from the system mall for him to follow the training regimen outlined in it. {ED: I'm sorry, what?}</p> <p>Since Da Ming seemed to have a faster rate of strength growth, it was best to focus more on training. If he was interested in chopping trees, then he could specialise in that area. With strength, he could chop trees faster than others, and even if he couldn't continue chopping trees in the future, he could do other tasks.</p> <p>Da Ming had a simple and honest personality, and Chen Ye didn't have too many expectations for him.</p> <p>As long as Da Ming could support himself in the future and grow up happily, that's all Chen Ye cared about. He applied tailored teaching methods to Da Ming.</p> <p>Externally, Xiao Lian seems unchanged from usual. She was diligent in managing household chores and her cooking skills had improved. She also showed patience in taking care of Xiaofu.</p> <p>However, beneath the surface, every night before Chen Ye went to sleep, he noticed Xiao Lian practising the "Jing Hua Finger" martial arts technique in the daily settlement information. From the system's description, her proficiency seems to be increasing steadily.</p> <p>This made Chen Ye want to ask her about it every time he saw her, but he restrained himself as he could not explain how he knew about Xiao Lian practising martial arts techniques.</p> <p>Chen Ye could only envy Xiao Lian's daily progress in her training.</p> <p>Furthermore, half a month ago, Xiao Lian's gratitude level was also activated, but it was only at 62%, and it didn't rise as quickly as Da Ming's, at least it was still better than nothing.</p> <p>Overall, everything seemed to be moving in a positive direction.</p> <p>The only thing that confused Chen Ye is the system missions. Since Da Ming triggered a mission progress once, the system missions seem to have died out, with no more prompts and stuck at 1/2 progress.</p> <p>After pondering for a while, Chen Ye tried to guide Xiao Lian subtly, hoping she would choose a profession that interests her and develop from there. However, Xiao Lian seemed to be interested in everything and nothing at the same time.</p> <p>This led to the system missions being put on hold.</p> <p>As a result, Chen Ye currently had no new orphan attributes and could not give them to Xiaofu.</p> <p>"Sigh, the rate at which points increase is still too slow... There are still too many places that require points."</p> <p>After Xiaofu was added, he exchanged some vaccines, which cost him a lot of points.</p> <p>In Yuhang County, after the child abduction case, there were no other major cases that month, only minor thefts and drunken brawls.</p> <p>Everything was progressing slowly and peacefully.</p> <p>As the weather got hotter, it became evident why Chen Ye preferred not to engage in physical labour.</p> <p>In the surrounding areas of Yuhang County, some families with the surname Qin worked tirelessly every day, enduring the scorching sun. It's hard work.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Chen Ye only needed to manage his own little plot of land, which was already enough for him.</p> <p>Of course, Chen Ye was a special case. Normally, the yamen would allocate a piece of land for the orphanage to cultivate.</p> <p>"Director!"</p> <p>From the courtyard came Xiao Lian's call, and Chen Ye got up, fanning himself with the fan, leisurely strolling into the courtyard.</p> <p>Under the shade of the trees in the courtyard, Da Ming lifted his head and innocently called out, "Dad."</p> <p>Da Ming was bare-chested, wearing shorts on the lower body, his skin showing a healthy wheat colour, with some muscle lines visible. After a month of training, there were noticeable changes in his body.</p> <p>"Why are you training again? It's so hot today. Wait until it's cooler before you continue."</p> <p>"Stop now."</p> <p>Chen Ye frowned slightly.</p> <p>Da Ming chuckled slightly and stopped. He didn't want to upset his dad.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Xiao Lian and asked, "What's wrong?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian carried a basket on her arm, her fair and lovely face showing a hint of fatigue.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye looking so relaxed, Xiao Lian couldn't help but feel a little resentful. Today was just too hot, and Xiaofu refused to sleep, making a lot of noise. It tired Xiao Lian out..</p> <p>"Director, Da Ming is growing so fast, I'm going to buy some cloth to make him some new clothes."</p> <p>"Buying ready-made clothes all the time is too expensive."</p> <p>Xiao Lian expressed her thoughts.</p> <p>After a month of getting to know each other, Chen Ye had a deeper understanding of Xiao Lian. She was intelligent, hardworking, and knew how to manage the household frugally. She could be considered an outstanding woman nurtured under the feudal system of ancient times.</p> <p>"Go ahead, be careful on the way."</p> <p>"Okay."</p> <p>Xiao Lian left with the basket slung over her shoulder.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>As soon as Xiao Lian stepped out of the courtyard gate, she breathed a sigh of relief. She took out some silver coins from her pocket, counted them, and then put them back.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's purpose for coming out was not just to buy some cloth; she was going to the blacksmith's.</p> <p>After a month of practice, her understanding of the "Jing Hua Zhi" had deepened.</p> <p>"Jing Hua Zhi" was a book that detailed hidden assassination techniques, belonging to the Yuzi's secret scroll within the Feng Yu Tower&#8217;s assassin organization.</p> <p>According to the descriptions in the book, Xiao Lian needed to comprehend various styles of hidden techniques and ultimately choose the one that suited her best.</p> <p>That was her main objective for going out.</p> <p>Xiao Lian glanced around with her lively eyes, seeing that there was no one around. She picked up a few stones from the ground and held them in her hand.</p> <p>With a flick of her fair hand, a stone appeared between her fingers.</p> <p>In the next instant, the stone flew out and shot towards a cicada on a tree branch five steps away.</p> <p>The cicada, which was chirping loudly on the tree branch, seemed to sense danger and rapidly flew away. However, just as it left the branch, it was hit by a stone and fell from the sky to the ground.</p> <p>Along with it, another stone fell from the tree branch. At the same time, a sound came from the tree, followed by another stone falling.</p> <p>On the ground, there was now an extra cicada and two stones.</p> <p>Seeing the scene, a satisfied expression appeared on Xiao Lian's pretty face. She had just shot out two stones.</p> <p>But no one knew when she had shot out the first stone or how she had hit the cicada.</p> <p>"Now, I can hit the target nine out of ten times. I've achieved a small mastery in the Jing Hua Zhi," Xiao Lian muttered to herself as she approached the fallen cicada and picked up the two stones.</p> <p>The hidden technique Xiao Lian had just used was symbolic of the "Brightness Beyond the Darkness" aspect of the "Jing Hua Zhi," representing achieving a small level of mastery.</p> <p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>"What does 'inner strength' mean?"</p> <p>"Guiding the Yuzi Jue&#8217;s inner strength, passing through the San Yin Meridians to the Hand's Taiyin Fei Meridian..."</p> <p>"What do these phrases mean?"</p> <p>Recalling the contents of the manual, a trace of worry appeared between Xiao Lian's brows.</p> <p>Each word in the &#8220;Jing Hua Zhi" manual she could understand, but there were some parts where she didn't grasp the meaning. Moreover, after flipping through it for some time, Xiao Lian realized that the book was incomplete.</p> <p>The content after achieving some mastery was mostly descriptions of using inner strength, with fewer techniques, giving it a sense of incompleteness. The book mentioned that the full potential of the Jing Hua Technique could only be realized when combined with inner strength.</p> <p>But Xiao Lian knew nothing about inner strength.</p> <p>With a sigh, Xiao Lian lifted her basket and headed towards the market.</p> <p>There weren't many people at the market, as the sun was too harsh, and the vendors were seeking shelter in the shade, fanning themselves.</p> <p>Xiao Lian lowered her head, pondering about inner strength.</p> <p>Suddenly, she noticed several people near the wall exchanging glances, and one of them left the shade and approached a woman.</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips slightly.</p> <p>Those people were habitual thieves from the neighborhood, and they seemed to have targeted their "prey."</p> <p>Following their gaze, Xiao Lian saw a woman walking down the street, carrying a sword in her left hand, dressed in a black dress, and wearing a veil.</p> <p>The woman walked gracefully, with an embroidered money pouch hanging from her waist.</p> <p>The thieves glanced at the woman's pouch, pretending to be indifferent as they approached her.</p> <p>Seeing that the victim was a woman, Xiao Lian frowned.</p> <p>Coincidentally, she still had two stones in her hand.</p> <p>Xiao Lian took two quick steps forward, keeping herself within five steps of both the thieves and the woman. She knew she could only guarantee accuracy within five steps. Once it exceeded that distance, her aim would significantly decrease.</p> <p>As the thief approached the woman, he reached out his right hand, revealing a shining blade between his fingers. He passed by the woman as if brushing past her.</p> <p>Just as his hand touched the money pouch, he was hit by something, causing him to startle.</p> <p>The blade fell from his hand with a light clatter.</p> <p>The woman in the black dress stopped in her tracks, her eyes flashing with surprise. The thief didn't hesitate to flee, and the woman didn't chase after him but turned to look behind her.</p> <p>Her gaze swept over the scene.</p> <p>The vendors seeking shade, the hurried pedestrians, and the girl holding a basket with a worried expression...</p> <p>Her gaze paused for a moment on the girl with the basket before quickly withdrawing. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of a stone on the ground.</p> <p>"The techniques of the Jing Hua Zhi from the Feng Yu Tower."</p> <p>Qin Yi thought to herself.</p> <p>She didn't linger her gaze and continued walking forward.</p> <p>Xiao Lian lifted her head slightly and glanced at the woman in the black dress, who was gradually moving away. A hint of suspicion flickered in her eyes.</p> <p>Did she just glance at me? It must be my imagination, right? I was facing away from her, so how could she see me?</p> <p>Xiao Lian shook her head, dispelling the unrealistic thoughts from her mind.</p> <p>First, she went to the famous "Qingjin Cloth Shop" in Yu Hang County to buy some cloth, and then she headed to the blacksmith's shop.</p> <p>Qin Yi walked gracefully on the stone-paved road of Yu Hang County.</p> <p>The cold attribute inner strength within her body circulated slowly, dispersing the heat of summer.</p> <p>That girl just now had no trace of inner strength, yet she knew the techniques of the Jing Hua Zhi&#8217;s hidden weapons.</p> <p>Could she be one of Executor Huang&#8217;s new apprentices?</p> <p>Qin Yi found the encounter just now intriguing.</p> <p>Since being promoted to a gold medal assassin, there were very few things in the world that could pique her interest.</p> <p>Apart from missions, it was just missions.</p> <p>She diligently fulfilled her duties as an assassin.</p> <p>Lost in thought, Qin Yi crossed the street, passed by several residences, and arrived at a dark alley. Her gaze swept over the three markings at the corner of the alley, and she paused her steps, walking into the alley.</p> <p>The alley wasn't long, only a few hundred meters. After passing through it, a dilapidated tavern appeared at the end.</p> <p>There were no customers in the tavern, only a faint smell of inferior wine lingering in the air. Qin Yi entered the tavern, and her aquamarine eyes glanced behind the counter.</p> <p>A short and stout old man was sitting in a recliner, eyes closed, deep in sleep.</p> <p>His face was flushed with alcohol, and a prominent red nose was quite eye-catching. There was a transparent thread dangling from the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>It was evident that the old man was sleeping soundly.</p> <p>Qin Yi stood beside the counter, extending her slender, snowy-white hand to lightly tap on the tabletop.</p> <p>"Thud, thud, thud..."</p> <p>Hearing the noise, the old man's body trembled, and he opened his eyes, yawning. A strong smell of alcohol wafted over.</p> <p>Qin Yi silently took a step back.</p> <p>"What kind of wine would the guest like?"</p> <p>"We have fine yellow wine and heated white wine here."</p> <p>"The wine I want, I'm afraid you don't have it." Qin Yi's voice was calm, devoid of any emotion, but upon closer listening, it carried a subtle charm.</p> <p>Upon hearing this, a glimmer of light flashed in the old man's eyes.</p> <p>"Then the guest must be asking for Nu Er Hong."</p> <p>"Why is that?"</p> <p>"Because, other than Nu Er Hong, we have everything else."</p> <p>"Then I'll take two barrels." Qin Yi said calmly.</p> <p>The old man's attitude immediately became respectful. He stepped outside the tavern, glanced around, and closed the door.</p> <p>Qin Yi took out a golden waist token from her waist, flashing it in front of the old man.</p> <p>"I want the latest information on Tang Feng from the Tang Sect and his whereabouts."</p> <p>"Please wait a moment." The old man's tone became more respectful.</p> <p>He turned and went into the kitchen.</p> <p>Qin Yi listened attentively, hearing a few faint murmurs and the sound of the old man moving around in the kitchen.</p> <p>After a while, the old man lifted the curtain of the kitchen and handed a silk embroidered sachet to Qin Yi. The old man walked over to Qin Yi and handed her the sachet.</p> <p>Qin Yi took the sachet but didn't leave immediately.</p> <p>Instead, she chose to open the sachet in the tavern. Inside was a neatly folded piece of paper.</p> <p>Written on it in small, neat handwriting were some pieces of information.</p> <p>After a moment, Qin Yi memorized the information on it, casually placed the sachet on the counter, and left the tavern.</p> <p>Once Qin Yi left, the old man went back into the kitchen and took out pen and paper.</p> <p>He lightly dipped the brush into the ink, swiftly wrote a few words in small, neat handwriting on the paper: "Yu Luo Sha has been hooked."</p> <p>After finishing, he folded the paper, took out a pigeon from a cage, placed the paper in a bamboo tube attached to the pigeon's leg, and released the pigeon.</p> <p>"Flap, flap..."</p> <p>The pigeon spread its wings and flew into the sky.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p><em class="chakra-text css-0">Tang Feng is right in Yuhang County, hiding in the Yue Lai Inn in the southern part of the city, residing in Room No.1</em></p> <p>At first glance, this information seemed impossible. However, intelligence from the Fengyu Tower had never been wrong. Out of trust in the Fengyu Tower, Qin Yi believed this piece of information.</p> <p>Half a month ago, Tang Feng, a true disciple of the Tang Clan, fled to Shaoxing Prefecture and was tracked down by three true disciples of Jiangnan Thunder Hall. The two sides clashed on the banks of the Fengqiao River.</p> <p>That night, continuous explosions could be heard within a radius of two miles from the Fengqiao River. The next day, the people from Liu Shan Men Sect found three bodies on the riverbank, with the ground covered in charred marks.</p> <p>From the clothing, the deceased appeared to be from the Thunder Hall. All three corpses had faces turned blue, eyes bulging, and laying stiff on the ground. Their hidden weapons, silver coins, and other personal belongings were all taken.</p> <p>After examining the bodies, the head of security of the Liu Shan Men Sect in Shaoxing Prefecture discovered several hair-thin curled needles in the acupoints of the bodies, each needle with a dark green sheen.</p> <p>These were Tang Clan's Dragon Whisker Needles.</p> <p>Tang Feng had already mastered the Dragon Whisker Needles and the related techniques!</p> <p>This news caused a sensation in the martial world. Jiangnan Thunder Hall&#8217;s hall master was furious and issued a kill order. All disciples above the second grade were dispatched to hunt down Tang Feng.</p> <p>Tang Feng's name surged to the top of the Fengyu Tower's Earth List of wanted targets.</p> <p>Killing Tang Feng and obtaining the Dragon Whisker Needle manual would reward 1000 taels of gold, a first-grade internal martial arts manual, and two second-grade martial arts manuals.</p> <p>This news caused a swarm of Fengyu Tower assassins to flock to Shaoxing Prefecture like bees to honey. But within half a month, the Fengyu Tower lost two gold-level assassins and seven silver-level assassins.</p> <p>Since then, no one dared to accept the mission to assassinate Tang Feng, his whereabouts vanishing from public view.</p> <p>Qin Yi had originally thought Tang Feng had fled north but was surprised to find he was still in the Jiangzhe area. However, this was also fortunate, as she didn't have to travel far to pursue him.</p> <p>Qin Yi walked through the streets of Yuhang County, which were nearly deserted. The scorching sunlight beat down on the ground, making the earth radiate a burning heat. Wherever she passed, small patches of ice would form under her feet, quickly melting into water under the sun's rays and then rapidly evaporating.</p> <p>Qin Yi glanced at the direction and headed south of the city, pondering Tang Feng's strength as she walked.</p> <p>A month ago, when Tang Feng defected from the Tang Sect, he only had the strength of a second-grade beginner. The three disciples from Thunder Hall who pursued him were all at the mid-second-grade level &#8212; Yet, they died at Tang Feng's hands.</p> <p>This indicated that Tang Feng's true strength might be close to the late second-grade.</p> <p>Tang Feng was the top talent the Tang Sect had seen in the past twenty years, possessing a profound talent in the art of hidden weapons. He was highly regarded by the clan, but for some unknown reason, he stole the Dragon Whisker Needle manual, injured an elder, and fled the Tang Sect.</p> <p>Qin Yi's eyebrows furrowed slightly as she felt there might be more to the story.</p> <p>It was said that only the Tang Sect's patriarchs could master the Dragon Whisker Needles. They were extremely powerful, capable of piercing through internal energy defenses. Their lethality was multiplied with their minuscule size.</p> <p>Combined with the possibility of being poisoned, they were nearly impossible to guard against and those hit by the needles, if their internal energy wasn't strong enough to expel them, would face certain death.</p> <p>Given Tang Feng's talent, inheriting the clan leadership in the future was not out of the question. Considering this, why would Tang Feng injure an elder and defect from the sect just for the Dragon Whisker Needles?</p> <p>After some thought, Qin Yi's eyes narrowed. Perhaps this matter wasn't as simple as it seemed.</p> <p>While pondering, Qin Yi crossed Gongchen Street and arrived at Tang Feng's hiding place.</p> <p>Ahead, a three-zhang tall pole stood by the door, with four large red lanterns hanging from it, each with a large character, "Yue Lai Inn." The inn's main hall was empty, with only the shopkeeper sitting on a long bench, constantly wiping sweat from his face.</p> <p>Seeing someone at the door, the shopkeeper hurriedly stood up and went over to greet them.</p> <p>"Guest, are you here to eat or stay?"</p> <p>Qin Yi entered the inn, took out a few pieces of silver from her purse, tossed them to the shopkeeper, and said flatly, "Stay."</p> <p>"I want a room from your Earth suite."</p> <p>The innkeeper weighed the silver in his hand, his face beaming with joy. He slung the rag over his shoulder and gestured towards the stairs, "This way, please."</p> <p>Qin Yi followed the innkeeper upstairs. After walking a short distance, she saw the first room of the Earth suite. The door to Room 1 was tightly closed. Qin Yi listened carefully but heard no sounds from within.</p> <p>Tang Feng was not in the room.</p> <p>The innkeeper led Qin Yi to Room 3 of the Earth suite, opened the door, and said, "The first two Earth rooms are already occupied."</p> <p>"No matter." Qin Yi's voice was indifferent.</p> <p>After entering the room, the innkeeper inquired attentively, and seeing that Qin Yi had no further requests, he left the room. Qin Yi walked to the bed, sat cross-legged, and quietly waited for Tang Feng to return.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Ding~ Ding~</p> <p>The sound of a hammer striking iron came from the blacksmith's shop, accompanied by waves of heat.</p> <p>Xiao Lian only stood by the furnace for a moment before she felt drenched in sweat. She took a handkerchief from her bosom and wiped the sweat from her face.</p> <p>Ding~ Ding~</p> <p>After a few more strikes, the blacksmith put down his hammer, walked over, and picked up a bucket full of water.</p> <p>The blacksmith was shirtless, his muscles tight and glistening with sweat. Under the reflection of the furnace, he appeared very strong. The blacksmith first drank heartily from the bucket and then poured the remaining water over himself. After doing this, he let out a satisfied sigh and looked at Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Seeing that it was a pretty young girl, the blacksmith couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>"Miss, what would you like to forge?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips, took out a piece of paper from her bosom, and said crisply, "I want to forge something according to this drawing."</p> <p>The blacksmith took the drawing from Xiao Lian. When he saw what was depicted on it, he frowned.</p> <p>The drawing showed a needle one inch long, but the end of the needle was connected together, forming a cone shape. {ED: I have no idea what that means. I have genuinely tried to visualise this for hours but couldn&#8217;t. Anyone capable of visualising this, please help me out.}</p> <p>This strange item was something the blacksmith had never seen before. He couldn't help but look up at Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's clear eyes met the blacksmith's gaze with an open and honest look. With a hint of anticipation in her voice she asked, "Can you make it?"</p> <p>The blacksmith stared at the drawing for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "I can."</p> <p>A look of delight appeared on Xiao Lian's pretty face.</p> <p>"How many do you need?" the blacksmith asked.</p> <p>He didn't ask what Xiao Lian was going to use it for. He was just a blacksmith, and his master had told him long ago not to ask customers what they were going to use things for; it was enough just to make it.</p> <p>Xiao Lian tilted her head and thought for a moment, then said, "How much for one?"</p> <p>"Ten copper coins."</p> <p>Hearing the price, Xiao Lian breathed a sigh of relief. It was cheaper than she had expected. After some thought, Xiao Lian said, "I'll take ten for now."</p> <p>The "Jin Hua Zhi" manual recorded more than a dozen types of hidden weapons, and she needed to try each one. From these, she would select the one most suitable for her.</p> <p>The one she was asking the blacksmith to make now was the Plum Blossom Needle, which would leave a small wound shaped like a plum blossom on the enemy when it hit. Xiao Lian had carefully chosen this from the various hidden weapon designs.</p> <p>The Plum Blossom Needle's appearance was just a bit strange, unlike darts or willow leaf knives, which would immediately raise suspicions.</p> <p>The blacksmith kept the drawing and picked up his hammer again, saying, "This is a small item. No need to pay a deposit. Come back tomorrow at this time."</p> <p>The blacksmith swung his hammer again, sweat pouring off him as he worked. The hammer struck the iron heated to a fiery red, sending sparks flying.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Xiao Lian left the blacksmith's shop and looked up at the sun, feeling a bit troubled. She wiped the sweat from her face and thought about how she still needed to take care of Xiao Fu later. Her lips pouted involuntarily.</p> <p>Xiao Fu didn't have the demeanor of a young lady; she was too lively. Xiao Lian sighed softly and walked towards the orphanage. As soon as she entered the courtyard, she heard Xiao Fu's crying and Chen Ye's soothing voice.</p> <p>"Xiao Fu, don't cry. Want to see the director make a funny face for you?"</p> <p>"Bleh, bleh, bleh..." {ED: I did not wake up today thinking that I&#8217;d have so much problem over dubbing the sound of a child stopping their crying. Anyone have anything better to suggest?}</p> <p>Xiao Lian entered the room and saw Chen Ye with his hands by his ears, flapping them while making funny faces.</p> <p>On a small bed sat a baby with pink skin and sparse black hair. She had a pair of big, bright eyes and a faint smile at the corners of her mouth. Watching Chen Ye make funny faces, she giggled non-stop.</p> <p>Chen Ye, hearing the sound behind him, turned around and saw Xiao Lian. He looked relieved and said, "Xiao Lian, you're finally back."</p> <p>Xiao Fu, seeing Chen Ye turn away, pouted and started to make a low whining sound as if she was about to cry again.</p> <p>Hearing the whining, Chen Ye gritted his teeth, "This little demon."</p> <p>He turned back quickly, changing his expression to a smile.</p> <p>"Bleh, bleh, bleh..."</p> <p>Chen Ye made a few more funny faces, and Xiao Fu finally stopped whining and started laughing again.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye playing with the child, Xiao Lian couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>Her eyes filled with admiration as she looked at Chen Ye. After a month of living together, Xiao Lian had realized that even though Chen Ye was very young, he had a lot of patience and treated all the children with kindness.</p> <p>Whether it was the older children or Xiao Fu, he treated them all equally, as if they were his own.</p> <p>During this month at the orphanage, Chen Ye was always cheerful and upbeat. According to Chen Ye, this place was full of positive energy. Moreover, Chen Ye was very good to her as well.</p> <p>Thinking about this, a peculiar glint appeared in Xiao Lian's lively eyes, and a faint blush crept across her pretty cheeks. {ED: Author, you are walking on very thin ice here. Very thin ice.}</p> <p>While teasing Xiao Fu, Chen Ye lowered his voice and said, "Quick, Xiao Lian, switch back."</p> <p>"This little troublemaker, she's doing it on purpose. I can't take it anymore."</p> <p>Hearing this, Xiao Lian froze and locked eyes with Xiao Fu. Xiao Fu, seeing Xiao Lian, blinked her big, bright eyes and stretched out her arms, indicating she wanted to be held.</p> <p>Xiao Lian put the newly bought cloth on the table, hurriedly ran out of the room, and said in a flustered tone, "Director, you keep coaxing her for a while."</p> <p>"I... I need to go wash clothes."</p> <p>"Xiao Lian, one must keep their promises..." Chen Ye's sorrowful voice trailed behind her.</p> <p>"Ha ha ha..."</p> <p>Xiao Fu seemed to find something amusing, laughing non-stop.</p> <p>Xiao Lian left the room and went into the courtyard. She saw Da Ming sitting in the study, earnestly reading the illustrated edition of "Water Margin." After reading it once with Da Ming, Chen Ye had given him the "Water Margin."</p> <p>Da Ming loved it and could spend hours sitting on the stool, engrossed in the book.</p> <p>"Da Ming, give me you and the director's clothes." Xiao Lian stood outside the study and called out to Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming paused his reading, a silly smile spreading across his face, and he ran out of the study, heading to his and Chen Ye's room to fetch the dirty clothes. He handed them to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Xiao Lian picked up a wooden basin, put all the clothes in it, and left the courtyard.</p> <p>In the southern part of Yuhang County, there is a tributary of the Qiantang River where the locals often go to wash their clothes. Under the scorching sun, Xiao Lian made her way to the riverbank, her forehead already covered in glistening sweat. Although the weather was hot, Xiao Lian preferred washing clothes over taking care of Xiao Fu.</p> <p>Reaching the riverbank, the sound of the flowing water was soothing, bringing a refreshing feeling just by listening. Xiao Lian found a spot under the shade of a tree, put down the wooden basin, and rolled up her sleeves, dipping her fair hands into the cool river water.</p> <p>She scooped up a handful of water and gently splashed it on her face, instantly dispelling much of the heat.</p> <p>"Haaah..."</p> <p>Xiao Lian closed her eyes in comfort, feeling much cooler.</p> <p>She bent down, soaked the clothes in the flowing water until they were thoroughly wet, and then placed them in the basin. She took out a bamboo tube and poured some white granular powder from it.</p> <p>This white powder was what the director called laundry detergent. Its effectiveness was many times better than soapberry. The director always brought out some strange and wonderful things, each time astonishing Xiao Lian.</p> <p>The director was indeed a peculiar person.</p> <p>Despite having the ability to easily earn a large amount of silver with his skills, he chose to run an orphanage. As she washed the clothes, Xiao Lian's thoughts wandered.</p> <p>Time flowed by like the river.</p> <p>Soon, the clothes in the basin were almost completely washed. There were also a few white bubbles on the surface of the river. Xiao Lian soaked the clothes in the river once more.</p> <p>Suddenly, she felt as though someone was watching her.</p> <p>Xiao Lian tilted her head slightly and noticed that, at some point, a man had appeared in the shade of a nearby tree. He was wearing a purple silk robe, with a jade belt around his waist and holding a folding fan. His figure was tall and slender, exuding a certain elegance. His features were handsome, but unfortunately, there was a large mole on his face, about the size of a copper coin. {ED: Damn, that sounds almost as bad as me.}</p> <p>This mole completely ruined his otherwise good looks. The man ended up looking rather unattractive.</p> <p>Xiao Lian glanced up at him, noticing his intense and somewhat sinister gaze fixed on her. Under that kind of scrutiny, Xiao Lian felt as though centipedes were crawling over her, making her extremely uncomfortable.</p> <p>A flash of anger crossed Xiao Lian's face. She glared at the man coldly before resuming her washing. If he continued to stare, she planned to move to another spot. It was extremely rude to keep staring at someone like that.</p> <p>As Xiao Lian focused on her washing, the man's voice suddenly reached her ears.</p> <p>"Miss, do you have a betrothed?" She looked up and was startled.</p> <p>The man, who had just been standing in the shade, was now right beside her. His eyes were fervent, and his Adam's apple bobbed slightly as he stared at Xiao Lian without blinking.</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn't respond, but a flicker of anger passed through her eyes. She picked up her basin and walked away without looking back.</p> <p>The man, staring at Xiao Lian's retreating figure, licked his lips.</p> <p>"A true beauty, pure and untouched..." {ED: She is 13 btw&#8230;}</p> <p>A smile spread across the man's face. With a swift movement, he appeared three meters away, catching up to Xiao Lian in an instant. He extended his folding fan, gently tapping Xiao Lian with it.</p> <p>As she hurried along with her basin, Xiao Lian suddenly felt a numbing sensation and couldn't move.</p> <p>The man, who had been behind her, was now in front of her, his face showing a sinister smile, and his fan lightly tapping the palm of his left hand.</p> <p>He bowed respectfully and said, "Miss, upon seeing your natural beauty and grace, I couldn't help but be captivated."</p> <p>"I earnestly request that you come to my residence, so we might have a pleasant conversation..."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>In Yuhang County, at the Yue Lai Inn.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on the bed, Qin Yi suddenly opened her eyes, revealing a shimmering light in her autumn-like eyes.</p> <p>"I'm back."</p> <p>She muttered to herself, then picked up the sword placed beside the bed, got up, and pushed open the door. As if no one else were around, she swiftly walked to the door of room number one on the ground floor, a flash of sword light passing by.</p> <p>The lock hanging on the door snapped apart with a crisp sound. Qin Yi still held the sword in her left hand, maintaining her stance as if she hadn't drawn the sword at all. She picked up the broken lock from the ground and pushed open the door.</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Creak</del></p> <p>In the moment the door opened, several dark shadows rushed towards her, emitting a dull thudding sound. The sword light shimmered, accompanied by several crisp clangs and clinks. Several crossbow arrows lay broken into halves on the ground. Qin Yi stepped over the broken arrows, still holding the sword in her left hand, as if she had never attacked.</p> <p>Entering room number one on the ground floor, Qin Yi sat quietly in the center of the room on a chair, waiting patiently. After a moment, a man's surprised voice came from outside the door.</p> <p>"Huh?"</p> <p>The door was pushed open, and a figure walked in. A dazzling sword light flashed by, swift to the extreme.</p> <p>"Hmm?"</p> <p>In the room, Qin Yi's voice of confusion echoed.</p> <p>The sword light abruptly ceased, freezing in mid-air. A strand of jet-black hair floated down. Xiao Lian stared at the long sword hovering just above her head, her face pale with fear. The sword was less than an inch away from her, emanating a chilling coldness, sending a freezing sensation through her scalp.</p> <p>Xiao Lian felt a chilling sensation and a slight tingling on her head. Even though the sword hadn't actually fallen, Xiao Lian felt like she could die at any moment.</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Clap</del> <del class="chakra-text css-0">Clap</del></p> <p>A series of amused claps were heard from behind Xiao Lian.</p> <p>"Such a swift sword! Truly worthy of Yu Luo Sha, the top assassin of Fengyu Tower... Truly worthy of its fame!"</p> <p>Dressed in purple silk and satin, the man stood behind Xiao Lian, holding a folding fan in his right hand, resting it on her waist. The man looked at the woman in the black skirt standing in his room, his gaze greedy as he scanned her from top to bottom.</p> <p>The woman had a graceful figure, perfectly outlined under her black dress. A light veil partially covered her face, revealing only a pair of autumn-like eyes, which shimmered with a hint of disinterest.</p> <p>The man couldn't help but swallow his saliva.</p> <p>Qin Yi's gaze fell on Xiao Lian, whose face was pale, sensing a familiarity, as if she had seen her somewhere before.</p> <p>She looked at the man behind Xiao Lian, Tang Feng, her voice cold and indifferent, "Tang Feng, ranked first on the Earth List, carrying a bounty of 1000 gold taels, one first-grade internal skill manual, and two second-grade secret manuals."</p> <p>Qin Yi spoke without emotion, as if she were stating Tang Feng's worth.</p> <p>Behind Xiao Lian, Tang Feng burst into laughter at her words. He released the folding fan resting on Xiao Lian's waist and lightly tapped her with it. A warm flow spread from her body, and Xiao Lian felt control returning to her body.</p> <p>"Young lady, stand back a bit. We wouldn't want any accidents," Tang Feng said to Xiao Lian with a smile.</p> <p>With that, he unfolded his fan, portraying a gallant and refined demeanor as he looked at Qin Yi, "Today is truly my lucky day to encounter two such distinguished ladies."</p> <p>"It seems I'll have to entertain both of you well tonight."</p> <p>Tang Feng laughed heartily, exuding a somewhat charming aura, though the large copper coin-sized black mole on his face detracted from it all. To onlookers, it made him seem mismatched, even grotesque.</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn't hesitate. She turned around to leave, but Tang Feng stood in front of the door, blocking her way. Glancing at her, Tang Feng chuckled, "Young lady, if you stand back a bit, you won't have to wait too long."</p> <p>Xiao Lian's face turned pale, understanding his intentions well. This man named Tang Feng had no intention of letting her go. Xiao Lian bit her lip and looked at Tang Feng with a cold gaze.</p> <p>She slowly retreated to the corner of the room.</p> <p>Xiao Lian could already tell that these two were no ordinary individuals. With a light touch from Tang Feng, she lost her ability to move; although the woman in the black skirt hadn't moved visibly, her sword flashed, clearly moving at an incredible speed.</p> <p>Once Xiao Lian walked away, Tang Feng noticed the broken crossbow arrows on the ground.</p> <p>He nodded approvingly, "Miss Yu's sword is truly fast. A common second-grade expert like myself would likely have fallen prey to these crossbows if caught off guard. Yet Miss Yu managed to cut them all down. Impressive."</p> <p>With that, Tang Feng even bowed slightly, showing genuine respect.</p> <p>Qin Yi didn't waste words. Suddenly, several flashes of sword light flickered in the room, chilling the air.</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p> <p>Clang! Clang!</p> <p>The sound of metal clashed in the room. The ground was littered with broken dark projectiles. Standing in the corner of the room, Xiao Lian recognized a few of them from the descriptions she had heard before, and her heart raced.</p> <p>Dark projectiles!</p> <p>It was something mentioned in the techniques of the Jing Hua Zhi.</p> <p>Xiao Lian widened her eyes, fixedly watching the two in combat without blinking.</p> <p>Both of them moved at incredible speeds. Whenever Tang Feng launched a dark projectile, Xiao Lian couldn't see his hand move, only hearing the swift rustling of his sleeves.</p> <p>The woman in the black skirt wielded her sword single-handedly, its blade constantly flashing with cold light, intercepting every dark projectile Tang Feng sent her way, slicing them to the ground. Each flash of the sword was followed by the clatter of several dark projectiles hitting the floor.</p> <p>Suddenly, Tang Feng's figure flickered and appeared beside Qin Yi. In his hand appeared something unknown, raised high.</p> <p>Feigning concern, Tang Feng warned, "Miss Yu, this is the Dragon Whisker Needle, be careful!"</p> <p>At his words, Qin Yi's eyes narrowed, her movements becoming ethereal and unpredictable, the chill emanating from her sword intensifying. Despite it being summer and unbearably hot, Xiao Lian, several metres away from the two, couldn't help but shiver.</p> <p>Several black objects were thrown by Tang Feng.</p> <p>Qin Yi frowned slightly, on alert.</p> <p>She had never seen the Dragon Whisker Needle before, but she had heard of its formidable reputation. Without hesitation, Qin Yi's body moved like a ghostly retreat. Several black objects fell to the ground, emitting a pungent smell of sulphur.</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>Instantly, an explosion rang out. Inside the room, accompanied by black smoke rising, several flames flickered.</p> <p>Xiao Lian watched the scene unfold before her eyes, feeling a chill in her heart. She was deeply shocked.</p> <p>Previously, she had thought that her Jing Hua Zhi technique was quite powerful, at least among her peers. However, seeing these two engage in combat, their prowess was beyond her expectations.</p> <p>Inside the room, tables, chairs, and the floor were riddled with holes, littered with broken crossbow bolts and black scorch marks. As the black smoke gradually dissipated, there was no sign of the woman in the black skirt.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's face turned pale, biting her lip.</p> <p>'Had the woman in the black skirt lost?'</p> <p>Seeing no trace of Qin Yi in the black smoke, Tang Feng's lips curled slightly upwards.</p> <p>He was about to make a move when a dazzling flash of sword light suddenly appeared. Tang Feng's pupils contracted, his body stiffened. In disbelief, he slowly lowered his head, his hand touching his neck. His fingertips felt the warmth of fresh blood.</p> <p>"How is this possible?" Tang Feng's pupils tightened, his face filled with confusion and shock.</p> <p>The woman in the black skirt stood beside Tang Feng, slowly sheathing her sword. She still wore the same cold expression. Her eyes, like autumn water, showed no emotion whatsoever.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Bang!</p> <p>A look of unwillingness appeared on Tang Feng's face as he slowly knelt to the ground. Blood did not spurt from the wound on his neck; instead, a layer of blood-coloured frost sealed it, as if frozen by ice. His eyes bulged, refusing to close in death. He still had Dragon Whisker Needles left unused and now he was dead.</p> <p>Seeing the sudden fatal sword strike, Xiao Lian's face lit up with joy.</p> <p>She won! The woman in the black dress won! She was saved!</p> <p>But the next moment, Xiao Lian saw the black-dressed woman weaken and collapse. She leaned against the wall for support, but her left hand dropped the sword to the ground.</p> <p>'What's happening?'</p> <p>Xiao Lian's eyes widened in astonishment. Did she not win? Did they both perish together?</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Clap</del> <del class="chakra-text css-0">Clap</del></p> <p>Applause echoed from outside the door. Qin Yi's expression changed as she looked towards the entrance.</p> <p>A man dressed in crimson silk attire stepped in. He had a handsome face and a faint smile on his lips. He had a gentle demeanour, scholarly and refined, but his eyes held a cold, snake-like malice.</p> <p>Entering, the man clapped his hands a few more times and praised the barely standing Qin Yi, "As expected of Yu Luo Sha of Fengyu Tower. Killing my useless junior brother with just one sword stroke."</p> <p>Seeing the man who suddenly appeared, Qin Yi's eyes narrowed, her voice icy, "Tang Hao, fifth on the Earth Ranking Kill List, Tang Sect true disciple, second-grade mid-level strength. Bounty: 1,000 taels of gold and three second-grade secret manuals."</p> <p>"Indeed, it's me." Tang Hao smiled, his crimson attire and handsome looks contrasting with his snake-like, sinister gaze fixed on Qin Yi.</p> <p>He glanced at Tang Feng, who was lying on the ground, and sighed, "My junior brother truly is a romantic. Seeing Miss Yu's graceful figure, he knew at a glance that you were a rare beauty, so he refrained from using the Dragon Whisker Needles out of pity."</p> <p>"But I must say, my junior brother was indeed talented. In just half a month, he managed to understand the Pili Zi from Thunderbolt Hall and even cleverly replaced the gunpowder inside with Tang Sect's Soft Tendon Powder."</p> <p>"What is even more commendable is that he had the audacity to use his modified Thunderbolt on Miss Yu!"</p> <p>Tang Hao shook his head as he spoke, looking at Tang Feng's corpse with a hint of pity in his eyes. "Truly unaware of his impending doom."</p> <p>"Facing the signature assassin of Fengyu Tower, yet still preoccupied with such thoughts. If he had used his real skills, he wouldn't have died so quickly."</p> <p>Tang Hao's gaze turned mocking as he looked at Tang Feng's body.</p> <p>Qin Yi's expression remained unchanged, her eyes coldly fixed on Tang Hao from behind her veil.</p> <p>"You're staying in Room Two of the Earth section?"</p> <p>"Smart."</p> <p>Tang Hao smiled faintly.</p> <p>He wasn't in a hurry to kill Qin Yi. The Tang Sect's Soft Tendon Powder caused the victim to feel weak and powerless for the duration of one tea session, and only the Tang Sect's unique antidote could cure it. {ED: And people say Americans use weird units of measurement...}</p> <p>Qin Yi lowered her gaze and spoke in a calm voice, "You found Tang Feng's trail long ago?"</p> <p>Tang Hao chuckled at her words. "Not found, I was always here."</p> <p>Hearing this, a flicker of emotion crossed Qin Yi's eyes for the first time.</p> <p>'He was always here...'</p> <p>The implications of this statement were deeply unsettling. Various theories quickly flashed through Qin Yi's mind, and she eliminated them one by one.</p> <p>Tang Hao had been with Tang Feng all along. If they had been together the whole time, the Tang Sect would be pursuing both Tang Feng and Tang Hao, not just Tang Feng alone. Therefore, the theft of the Dragon Whisker Needle blueprint must be a ruse.</p> <p>Understanding this, Qin Yi looked at Tang Hao and coldly said, "Tang Feng didn't steal the Dragon Whisker Needle blueprint; this is a setup by the Tang Sect."</p> <p>"Impressive. Miss Yu, you are indeed as clever as they say, figuring out the truth." Tang Hao's handsome face showed genuine surprise at Qin Yi's deduction.</p> <p>Receiving confirmation, Qin Yi suddenly lifted her head, a ripple of emotion appearing in her cold eyes. "Is this a trap set for Fengyu Tower? Why?"</p> <p>Tang Hao's smile abruptly vanished, his expression turning cold. His eyes, like those of a venomous snake, were icy and menacing.</p> <p>"I originally planned to keep you alive a bit longer, Miss Yu, to let you experience what it's like to be a woman before you die. But since you've figured it out, I'll send you on your way now. My useless junior brother shouldn't have gone far."</p> <p>"If you must blame someone, blame Fengyu Tower for being too ostentatious."</p> <p>Tang Hao didn't say more. Instantly, he shot out five or six hidden weapons, all aimed at Qin Yi.</p> <p>Just as Qin Yi had been leaning against the wall, she suddenly moved with ghostly speed, dodging all the hidden weapons. In a flash, she was in front of Tang Hao, her right hand, white as snow, striking towards his face.</p> <p>Tang Hao was shocked and had no time to think. He raised his right hand to meet Qin Yi's palm. Their palms clashed, and Tang Hao's face turned red. His eyes widened as his right hand trembled slightly.</p> <p>Qin Yi's eyes remained calm. Her petite, fair right hand extended forward, channelling a surge of icy internal energy straight into Tang Hao's palm. A layer of white frost quickly formed on Tang Hao's right hand.</p> <p>The two were locked in a battle of internal energy.</p> <p>Standing in the corner, Xiao Lian watched this sudden turn of events, her rosy lips slightly parted. The situation had changed too quickly, leaving her momentarily stunned.</p> <p>'Should she take this chance to escape?'</p> <p>The thought flashed through Xiao Lian's mind. But she quickly dismissed it.</p> <p>She had overheard the conversation between Tang Hao and Qin Yi. The outcome of their fight was still uncertain. If Tang Hao won, her fate would be death. He would kill her to silence her. Even though she didn't know what would happen if the woman in black won, Xiao Lian had no other choice.</p> <p>As she pondered, the battle took another sudden turn.</p> <p>Qin Yi's body suddenly went limp. Her hand broke contact with Tang Hao's, and she collapsed, powerless. Tang Hao hastily retreated several steps and sat down cross-legged on the ground.</p> <p>Xiao Lian was shocked to find that Tang Hao's face and eyebrows were covered in frost. His complexion was as pale as paper, and his teeth chattered uncontrollably. It was clearly summer, yet Tang Hao seemed to be living in the dead of winter.</p> <p>The Tang Sect was renowned for its mastery of hidden weapons, but its prowess in internal energy techniques was not as profound.</p> <p>Qin Yi's internal energy had a chilling quality, and her level of mastery was extremely high. In their clash of internal energy, Tang Hao felt as if his right arm had turned to ice, with every inch of skin radiating a stinging pain.</p> <p>Fortunately for him, the softening powder within Qin Yi had taken effect, leaving her unable to sustain herself. Otherwise, under Qin Yi's relentless, energy-draining assault, the outcome of their battle would have been uncertain. {ED: That's what she said.}</p> <p>Tang Hao sat cross-legged on the ground, closed his eyes, and began to regulate his breathing, using the Tang Sect's techniques to dispel the icy internal energy from his body.</p> <p>"Little girl..."</p> <p>Qin Yi suddenly spoke, her voice as soft as a mosquito's buzz. Xiao Lian turned her gaze to the collapsed Qin Yi, her pretty face expressionless. Upon hearing Qin Yi speak, Tang Hao's eyes snapped open, and he looked at Xiao Lian.</p> <p>"Little girl, kill him!"</p> <p>"Little girl, kill her!"</p> <p>Qin Yi and Tang Hao spoke simultaneously.</p> <p>"Little girl, I am a disciple of the Tang Sect. That demoness is a notorious killer in the martial world, her hands stained with countless lives. She is defenceless now. Killing her would be a great service to the people and an immeasurable act of righteousness! My Tang Sect will also reward you with 1,000 taels of silver. You'll never have to worry about money for the rest of your life."</p> <p>Tang Hao, his teeth chattering, spoke slowly but persuasively. He first pointed out Qin Yi's identity, elevating his own moral standing, and then offered a lucrative reward, demonstrating exceptional rhetorical skill.</p> <p>"Little girl, you heard everything just now. If he recovers, he won't spare you; he'll definitely kill you to silence you."</p> <p>Qin Yi, now extremely weak and almost inaudible, spoke softly.</p> <p>Both of their lives now depended entirely on Xiao Lian's decision. A single thought could lead to heaven or hell.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Xiao Lian didn't say a word; she had already made up her mind.</p> <p>Both of them had to die!</p> <p>However, she would kill Tang Hao first.</p> <p>Without a sound, Xiao Lian walked to Qin Yi's side. Tang Hao, who was channeling his inner strength to dispel the cold energy, saw this and looked delighted.</p> <p>"Good, little girl. People like her, who have killed countless innocents, deserve to die! Once you kill her, I'll give you 1,000 taels of silver!"</p> <p>Seeing Xiao Lian approach her, Qin Yi's autumn-water-like eyes dimmed slightly. She sighed inwardly. Was she going to die here today?</p> <p>It was fate.</p> <p>In her final moments, what concerned Qin Yi the most was why the Tang Sect had set a trap for Fengyu Tower. She had a faint feeling that Fengyu Tower's intelligence network had been compromised.</p> <p>Under Tang Hao's fervent gaze, Xiao Lian picked up the long sword that Qin Yi had dropped. As soon as her fair hand touched the sword, a piercing cold surged from it. Her fingers stung, and she let go, causing the sword to fall to the ground again.</p> <p>'So cold.'</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked down and saw that her fingertips were red and numb, as if she had dipped them in icy water in the middle of winter. Xiao Lian glanced around and noticed the bedsheet on the inn's bed. She tore it off and wrapped it around the sword's hilt.</p> <p>"Good, good, good! Little girl, you are truly clever! Once you kill this demoness, you'll be a great hero! You will be blessed with boundless merit!"</p> <p>Tang Hao continued to shower her with praises.</p> <p>Xiao Lian picked up the sword again, glanced coldly at Tang Hao, and then moved towards him. Seeing this, Tang Hao's expression changed, and he panicked.</p> <p>He hadn't expected Xiao Lian to pick up the sword to stab him!</p> <p>"Little girl, calm down. I am a disciple of a reputable sect. I will definitely give you the promised 1,000 taels."</p> <p>"With 1,000 taels, you can buy many clothes, jewelry, and even real estate..."</p> <p>Tang Hao kept talking, trying to make Xiao Lian stop. But Xiao Lian's gaze was resolute. She held the sword firmly, pointing it at Tang Hao. The distance between them was no more than ten steps.</p> <p>Qin Yi, who had resigned herself to death, was surprised and delighted by this unexpected turn of events.</p> <p>"Little girl, stop!" Qin Yi suddenly said.</p> <p>Hearing this, Xiao Lian stopped in confusion and looked at Qin Yi, unsure why she was being told to stop.</p> <p>"Little girl, he's a Tang Sect disciple. He likely has hidden mechanisms and traps on him. Approaching him so closely could make you vulnerable to an ambush."</p> <p>Qin Yi, lying weak on the ground, whispered to Xiao Lian in a faint voice. Xiao Lian stood still, recalling the contents of the "Jing Hua Zhi" manual.</p> <p>The world's hidden weapons are categorized into four types: mechanisms, thrown, poison sprays, and whips.</p> <p>Mechanism-based hidden weapons require the least skill to use; generally, just pressing a switch will fire the weapon.</p> <p>Thinking of this, Xiao Lian felt a chill of fear. If she had moved any faster, she might have already been killed.</p> <p>Xiao Lian threw down the sword, reconsidered, and then moved towards the already cold corpse of Tang Feng.</p> <p>She crouched down and searched Tang Feng's waist. Soon, she found a narrow silk pouch with some hard objects inside. Xiao Lian took the pouch from Tang Feng's waist and looked inside. It contained darts and iron caltrops, the tips glowing green with a faint fishy smell.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's face lit up with joy. This was a pouch for hidden weapons!</p> <p>As expected, as described in the book, hidden weapon users carry such pouches. Tang Hao saw Xiao Lian moving to Tang Feng's body and searching it, feeling an ominous premonition. Lying nearby, Qin Yi saw Xiao Lian pick up the pouch and suddenly remembered her.</p> <p>"Little girl, it's you," Qin Yi said, her voice tinged with excitement and joy.</p> <p>This little girl was from Fengyu Tower!</p> <p>Tang Hao, sitting cross-legged and channeling his internal energy, heard the excitement in Qin Yi's voice, and his face darkened. Damn it, these two know each other!</p> <p>Tang Hao was now furious, wanting nothing more than to tear Tang Feng's body apart. As a bandit, you captured a little girl, and it just so happened to be someone who knows Yu Luo Sha!</p> <p>Xiao Lian ignored Qin Yi, taking out a three-inch dart and examining it closely.</p> <p>After a moment of thought, she positioned the dart between her fingers and threw it towards Tang Hao using the flick-hand technique. Seeing Xiao Lian use the hand flick technique, Tang Hao was terrified.</p> <p>'It's over, this little girl knows how to use hidden weapons!'</p> <p>'My life is finished!'</p> <p>Tang Hao instinctively closed his eyes, feeling despair.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Clang</del></p> <p>First, there was the dull sound of the dart hitting wood, followed by the clinking sound of it falling to the ground. Tang Hao opened his eyes in confusion, seeing a dart on the ground not far from him.</p> <p>Qin Yi, lying on the ground, was also stunned.</p> <p>'When they were on the street, this little girl had clearly shown proficiency in the Jing Hua Finger technique, so why was her dart throwing so poor?'</p> <p>Xiao Lian's pretty, fair face remained expressionless. She took out another dart and casually threw it again.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p><del class="chakra-text css-0">Clang</del></p> <p>Just like before, it fell to the ground.</p> <p>Tang Hao's emotions surged like waves, his previously tense heart relaxed. He exhaled deeply, barely containing his excitement. It seemed this little girl hadn't been practicing with hidden weapons for long; her technique was clumsy, and her aim was poor!</p> <p>Tang Hao took a deep breath and quickly circulated his internal energy. There was still a chance. The frost on his face was slowly receding, turning into water. In a few more seconds, he would suppress the icy internal energy.</p> <p>Then, the outcome would be decided.</p> <p>Seeing that her two attempts had missed, Xiao Lian frowned slightly. Darts were different from stones; their weight and the feeling of throwing them were not the same. Even though she was good at throwing stones, it didn't mean she could hit her target with darts.</p> <p>Her fair hand reached into the hidden weapon pouch again, taking out another dart. This time, Xiao Lian didn't rush. She weighed it in her hand, feeling its weight.</p> <p>Tang Hao, seeing Xiao Lian pause, felt even more elated. In just a few more seconds, he would completely suppress Qin Yi's icy internal energy!</p> <p>Qin Yi noticed that Tang Hao's complexion was becoming more flushed, his breathing more steady. She sighed inwardly. Tang Hao was about to recover.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, after feeling the dart's weight, had a spark of understanding in her eyes. Her right hand reached into the hidden weapon pouch again.</p> <p>Whoosh!</p> <p>The dart in her hand flew out once again. Qin Yi, lying nearby, watched with tense eyes. Judging by the trajectory, this time it should hit!</p> <p>Just as the dart was about to strike Tang Hao, he suddenly turned his head, narrowly avoiding it. His body, previously stiff from the cold, was warming up quickly. Tang Hao had managed to suppress most of Qin Yi's icy internal energy.</p> <p>As Tang Hao thought he had evaded the dart, a shadow struck him in his left eye.</p> <p>"Ah!"</p> <p>Tang Hao let out a painful scream.</p> <p>A dart had precisely pierced his left eye.</p> <p>Qin Yi, lying on the ground, was stunned. She exclaimed, "Jing Hua Zhi mastery, a ray of hope in the darkness!"</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn't stop; she quickly took more darts from the hidden weapon pouch, using the same technique to shoot at Tang Hao. In extreme pain, Tang Hao couldn't dodge. The following darts hit his eyes, face, and neck.</p> <p>Knowing her strength was insufficient, Xiao Lian aimed for Tang Hao's vital points.</p> <p>With his eyes blinded and his face and neck injured, the poison on the darts quickly took effect. In the combined agony of pain and poison, Tang Hao could no longer focus on suppressing the internal energy, and frost rapidly formed on his face.</p> <p>Moments later, Tang Hao's body stiffened, and he collapsed.</p> <p>Seeing that she had killed Tang Hao, Xiao Lian's body trembled slightly, her heart pounding violently. A wave of panic surged within her.</p> <p>Did she really just kill someone?</p> <p>For the first-time killer Xiao Lian, a deep sense of anxiety and panic welled up in her heart. But soon, she gritted her teeth, suppressing her emotions. Her gaze turned icy as she looked at Qin Yi.</p> <p>There's still one more!</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"Phew..."</p> <p>"Finally asleep."</p> <p>Chen Ye let out a long sigh of relief as he watched the sleeping Xiaofu on the small bed. Although Xiaofu was very mischievous, she was still a toddler with limited energy, spending most of her time sleeping. Only when she was asleep could Chen Ye and Xiao Lian take a breather.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked around the courtyard, fanning himself with a round fan, noticing that he couldn't see Xiao Lian anywhere.</p> <p>"Where did that girl go? How can washing clothes take this long?"</p> <p>Chen Ye rolled up his sleeve to reveal a large Rolex watch and checked the time. Xiao Lian had been gone for more than an hour, which seemed unusual.</p> <p>"System, find out Xiao Lian's location," he mentally commanded.</p> <p>A virtual blue screen appeared before Chen Ye's eyes, with a red dot representing Xiao Lian blinking on the system map.</p> <p>"Hmm?" Chen Ye was puzzled by the location.</p> <p>Just then, Xiao Lian entered the courtyard with a wooden basin in her arms, seeing Chen Ye standing there lost in thought.</p> <p>"Headmaster," Xiao Lian called out sweetly.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at her, puzzled. "Why did it take you so long to wash the clothes today?"</p> <p>Based on previous experience, it shouldn't take Xiao Lian more than an hour to wash clothes. But today, it had taken her much longer.</p> <p>Xiao Lian lowered her head slightly, her expressive eyes avoiding Chen Ye's gaze. She casually explained, "It's hot today, so I stayed by the river a bit longer."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded in agreement. The weather was indeed hot, so it was reasonable for Xiao Lian to take some time by the river to cool off.</p> <p>"Let me help you with the clothes."</p> <p>"It's just a few pieces."</p> <p>After helping Xiao Lian hang the clothes, she thanked him and returned to her room. She sat on a chair, absentmindedly looking outside, recalling the recent events.</p> <p>In her memory, Xiao Lian gripped two throwing darts tightly, her eyes cold and filled with murderous intent as she looked at the paralyzed Qin Yi on the ground.</p> <p>Sensing the killing intent in Xiao Lian's eyes, Qin Yi spoke weakly, "You want to kill me? Aren't you from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian remained silent, assuming a stance to throw the dart.</p> <p>"Mastering Jing Hua Zhi without internal energy, and you're not from Fengyu Tower..." Qin Yi's voice was calm, but tinged with bewilderment and disbelief.</p> <p>Having witnessed Tang Hao's gruesome death, a fate soon to befall her, Qin Yi showed no fear. Her face was only calm, as if death was an inevitable end she had long accepted.</p> <p>Xiao Lian paused, the dart still in her hand. She looked at Qin Yi and asked in a clear voice, "Are you an assassin from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What is internal energy? What does it mean to use the inner force of the Rain-Inducing Art to cross the San Yin Meridians of the hand to the Taiyin Fei meridian of the hand?" Xiaolian asked, voicing the question that had puzzled her for days.</p> <p>She had seen Qin Yi fight, the damage both sides caused left her in awe. If she could wield such power, then...</p> <p>Killing that person would be very easy.</p> <p>Qin Yi was slightly stunned by Xiao Lian's question. She looked at Xiao Lian for a moment, then explained.</p> <p>Listening to the answer that had troubled her for days, Xiao Lian fell into deep thought.</p> <p>"I don't know where you got Jing Hua Zhi, but without an internal energy cultivation method, even with innate talent, you can't fully utilize its power. Moreover, Jing Hua Zhi is divided into three volumes, and what you have is likely just the first volume," Qin Yi said calmly, closing her eyes to regulate her internal energy.</p> <p>She had used the characteristics of her icy internal energy to suppress the effects of the Soft Tendon Powder earlier and then competed in internal energy with Tang Hao. Now, her icy internal energy was chaotic. If left unchecked, it would flow through the wrong meridians, leading to deviation.</p> <p>"How can I obtain an internal energy cultivation method? Where are the remaining volumes of Jing Hua Zhi?" Xiao Lian's confusion eased somewhat, but her knowledge of martial arts was still limited.</p> <p>"Become an assassin of Fengyu Tower and exchange merits for martial arts manuals," Qin Yi opened her eyes and stared at Xiao Lian for a long time. She then said softly, "Or, become my disciple."</p> <p>Qin Yi looked at Xiao Lian seriously, enunciating each word clearly, "You are a natural-born assassin!"</p> <p>"Wah wah wah..."</p> <p>Xiaofu woke up and started crying again. Xiao Lian snapped out of her memories.</p> <p>'You are a natural-born assassin.'</p> <p>She repeated it silently in her heart. After a long while, she sighed. The woman's voice seemed to still echo in her ears.</p> <p>"Tonight at midnight, I'll be waiting for you in the south of the city."</p> <p>Between killing Qin Yi and killing that person, Xiao Lian ultimately chose the latter.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Night quietly fell.</p> <p>Chen Ye returned to his room with Da Ming. Lying on the bed, he keenly felt that Xiao Lian had been acting strange since she came back in the afternoon.</p> <p>Although he didn't know what had happened to Xiao Lian, he hoped the daily summary would tell him the reason.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Daily settlement begins:&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Today, you took Da Ming and Xiao Lian to wash up, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;After washing up, you and Da Ming did some exercises together, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian prepared breakfast and took care of Xiaofu, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;The four of you had breakfast together, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Da Ming followed the "Schwarzenegger Training Method," significantly increasing his strength, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;{ED: I cannot get over that name.}</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian took care of Xiaofu, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;You took care of Xiaofu, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiaofu cried less today than the previous day, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Da Ming read the illustrated version of "Water Margin" and had some insights, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian made no progress in practicing "Jing Hua Zhi," rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian went to buy fabric in the market, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Encountering a thief, Xiao Lian stopped the crime, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian commissioned the blacksmith to make Plum Blossom Needles, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian voluntarily did the laundry, rewarded with 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian was captured by the bandit Tang Feng while on the street and taken to an inn. She remained calm throughout the ordeal, rewarded with 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>Seeing this, Chen Ye sat up abruptly, cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.</p> <p>"No way, could Xiao Lian's unusual state be because..."</p> <p>Chen Ye's heart skipped a beat. He forced down his unease and continued reading.</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian narrowly escaped death from Yu Luo Sha, earning 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian escaped from Tang Feng's grasp, earning 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian remained calm and observed a battle between two second-grade martial artists, earning 200 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian killed the second-grade martial artist Tang Hao, claiming her first kill, earning 500 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian apprenticed herself to Yu Luo Sha, earning 100 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian returned safely to the orphanage, earning 50 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;The four of you had dinner together, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;After dinner, you and Da Ming read books, improving your cultural level, earning 10 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Xiao Lian went back to her room to take care of Xiaofu, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;The three of you washed up and went to bed on time, earning 5 points.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Total points earned: 1080.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Current point balance: 5172.&#12305;</p> <p>'Huh!'</p> <p>Wait a minute, system.</p> <p>Chen Ye felt a bit stunned after seeing the summary points. He read the daily summary again, falling into silence.</p> <p>"So, in just over an hour this afternoon, Xiao Lian was kidnapped by bandits, witnessed a battle, killed a second-grade martial artist, and even found a master?"</p> <p>"Uhh..."</p> <p>"Isn't this a bit too outrageous?" Chen Ye couldn't help but mutter.</p> <p>A sense of absurdity rose within him, as if his calm life had suddenly been disrupted by something unexpected. Immediately after, the system's cold prompt sounded in Chen Ye's ear again.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Chen Da Ming's gratitude level has increased.

                            </p><p>"Phew..."</p> <p>"Finally asleep."</p> <p>Chen Ye let out a long sigh of relief as he watched the sleeping Xiaofu on the small bed. Although Xiaofu was very mischievous, she was still a toddler with limited energy, spending most of her time sleeping. Only when she was asleep could Chen Ye and Xiao Lian take a breather.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked around the courtyard, fanning himself with a round fan, noticing that he couldn't see Xiao Lian anywhere.</p> <p>"Where did that girl go? How can washing clothes take this long?"</p> <p>Chen Ye rolled up his sleeve to reveal a large Rolex watch and checked the time. Xiao Lian had been gone for more than an hour, which seemed unusual.</p> <p>"System, find out Xiao Lian's location," he mentally commanded.</p> <p>A virtual blue screen appeared before Chen Ye's eyes, with a red dot representing Xiao Lian blinking on the system map.</p> <p>"Hmm?" Chen Ye was puzzled by the location.</p> <p>Just then, Xiao Lian entered the courtyard with a wooden basin in her arms, seeing Chen Ye standing there lost in thought.</p> <p>"Headmaster," Xiao Lian called out sweetly.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at her, puzzled. "Why did it take you so long to wash the clothes today?"</p> <p>Based on previous experience, it shouldn't take Xiao Lian more than an hour to wash clothes. But today, it had taken her much longer.</p> <p>Xiao Lian lowered her head slightly, her expressive eyes avoiding Chen Ye's gaze. She casually explained, "It's hot today, so I stayed by the river a bit longer."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded in agreement. The weather was indeed hot, so it was reasonable for Xiao Lian to take some time by the river to cool off.</p> <p>"Let me help you with the clothes."</p> <p>"It's just a few pieces."</p> <p>After helping Xiao Lian hang the clothes, she thanked him and returned to her room. She sat on a chair, absentmindedly looking outside, recalling the recent events.</p> <p>In her memory, Xiao Lian gripped two throwing darts tightly, her eyes cold and filled with murderous intent as she looked at the paralyzed Qin Yi on the ground.</p> <p>Sensing the killing intent in Xiao Lian's eyes, Qin Yi spoke weakly, "You want to kill me? Aren't you from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian remained silent, assuming a stance to throw the dart.</p> <p>"Mastering Jing Hua Zhi without internal energy, and you're not from Fengyu Tower..." Qin Yi's voice was calm, but tinged with bewilderment and disbelief.</p> <p>Having witnessed Tang Hao's gruesome death, a fate soon to befall her, Qin Yi showed no fear. Her face was only calm, as if death was an inevitable end she had long accepted.</p> <p>Xiao Lian paused, the dart still in her hand. She looked at Qin Yi and asked in a clear voice, "Are you an assassin from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"What is internal energy? What does it mean to use the inner force of the Rain-Inducing Art to cross the San Yin Meridians of the hand to the Taiyin Fei meridian of the hand?" Xiaolian asked, voicing the question that had puzzled her for days.</p> <p>She had seen Qin Yi fight, the damage both sides caused left her in awe. If she could wield such power, then...</p> <p>Killing that person would be very easy.</p> <p>Qin Yi was slightly stunned by Xiao Lian's question. She looked at Xiao Lian for a moment, then explained.</p> <p>Listening to the answer that had troubled her for days, Xiao Lian fell into deep thought.</p> <p>"I don't know where you got Jing Hua Zhi, but without an internal energy cultivation method, even with innate talent, you can't fully utilize its power.

                            </p><p>Chen Ye was overjoyed. He had anticipated that Da Ming's gratitude level would reach 80% within a day or two, but he hadn't expected it to be today.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat up straight.</p> <p>The last time he received a Director skill, it was [Indestructable Body], which made him immune to all harm. What would he get this time?</p> <p>"System, draw a Director skill!" Chen Ye silently commanded in his mind.</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Drawing...&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ding!&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Congratulations, you have obtained the skill: Ground Shrinking Step&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ground Shrinking Step: You can shrink a distance of up to 100 meters into a single step, appearing at any reachable location within that range. No cooldown.&#12305;</p> <p>Seeing this trait, Chen Ye was ecstatic.</p> <p>This skill was incredibly powerful, not inferior to the Indestructable Body.</p> <p>As Chen Ye read the skill's description, his eyes narrowed, focusing on the phrase "reachable location."</p> <p>After some contemplation, he understood its meaning.</p> <p>For instance, he couldn't appear directly 100 meters in the air.</p> <p>If he could appear directly 100 meters in the air, it wouldn't be called Ground Shrinking Step; it would be called Skywalking.</p> <p>"In other words, as long as I take a step, I can appear anywhere up to 100 meters away?"</p> <p>Chen Ye stroked his chin, "This is a godly skill on earth. From now on, I won't even need a horse to travel; no horse could match my speed."</p> <p>"One step, 100 meters. Who could possibly catch up?"</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled slightly and opened his status panel.</p> <p>&#12304;Orphan Cultivation System 1.0&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Host: Chen Ye&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Age: 20&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Points: 5172&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Possessed Director skills: Indestructible Body, Ground Shrinking Step&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Indestructible Body: Your body cannot be harmed by anything in the world.&#12305;</p> <p>&#12304;Ground Shrinking Step: You can shrink a distance of up to 100 meters into a single step, appearing at any reachable location within that range.

If I could draw an attack method, I'd probably dominate all martial artists."</p> <p>After drawing the trait, Chen Ye lay down contentedly to sleep.</p> <p>Just as he settled in, he was awakened by the cries of a child next door. It was Xiaofu.</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed, rolled over, covered his ears, and hoped silently, "Xiao Lian, please take care of the little troublemaker."</p> <p>In such situations, Xiao Lian would usually comfort Xiaofu for a while, soothing her until Chen Ye could continue sleeping.</p> <p>Several minutes passed, and Xiaofu's crying didn't stop. Chen Ye realized something was wrong.</p> <p>He got up and walked to the door of the room where Xiao Lian and Xiaofu slept, knocking softly.</p> <p>There was no response from inside. Chen Ye activated the system map and noticed that Xiao Lian's red dot was not in the nursery.</p> <p>It was in the southern part of the city.</p> <p>Rubbing his forehead, Chen Ye muttered, "She's not giving me any peace of mind, especially during curfew..."</p> <p>He sighed and pushed open the door, picked up Xiaofu, and began to calm her down.</p> <p>...</p> <p>In the southern part of the city, deep into the night, the moon hung low, casting a cool, silvery glow on the ground, just enough to see by.</p> <p>"Dong dong..."</p> <p>The sound of the night watchmen's bells echoed from the corners of the city.</p> <p>Several patrols carried lanterns, yawning as they walked the streets.</p> <p>Xiao Lian cautiously made her way to the south of the city, almost being spotted by the night patrols. Luckily, her petite stature allowed her to hide in the shadows, and the guards weren't too diligent to notice her.</p> <p>Southern City, Southern City</p> <p>Southern City is so big, where exactly am I supposed to meet her?</p> <p>Xiao Lian hid under a tree, grumbling internally.</p> <p>"You've come."</p> <p>A calm, emotionless woman's voice came from behind Xiao Lian, startling her. She turned to see a woman in a black dress standing beside her.</p> <p>The woman wore a veil, her eyes like clear autumn water, gazing at Xiao Lian.</p> <p>It was Qin Yi.</p> <p>Xiao Lian breathed a sigh of relief. She lifted her head, looking directly at Qin Yi with a determined gaze, her voice crisp, "I'm here."</p> <p>Qin Yi glanced at her lightly, a slight smile tugging at her lips, "Is this how you greet your master?"</p> <p>Hearing this, Xiao Lian's delicate face turned red. She stammered a bit before saying, "Master."</p> <p>"Hmm." Qin Yi accepted this unexpected disciple.</p> <p>Without much ceremony, Qin Yi took out three thread-bound books, two small and one large, handing them to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>"The two small ones are the Fengyu Tower's 'Rain Technique Manual' and 'Drifting Rain Footwork,' the large one is the Tang Sect's 'General Principles of Hidden Weapons.'"</p> <p>Qin Yi's voice was monotonous, but upon careful listening, one could hear a hint of elegance and gentleness.</p> <p>Xiao Lian took the three books, feeling puzzled and asked, "Master Yu, I've already practiced the first volume of the 'Jinghua Finger.'"</p> <p>"My surname is not Yu, it's Qin, and my name is Qin Yi."</p> <p>"Fengyu Tower's assassins are all named by numbers. By rights, you should also take a number as your name."</p> <p>"But since you are my disciple and not officially part of the Fengyu Tower, I won't insist on the name."</p> <p>Qin Yi stood with her sword, the summer wind blowing, her black dress swaying, accentuating her graceful figure.</p> <p>She paused and continued, "You haven't practiced any internal energy techniques. Reaching the small success stage with the Jinghua Finger technique is your limit. If you want to continue, you need to cultivate the Rain Technique Manual to at least the second level."</p> <p>"Only then can you reach the level of a fourth-grade martial artist."</p> <p>"I observed your exceptional talent with hidden weapons, so I'm giving you the Tang Sect's General Principles of Hidden Weapons."</p> <p>"The Tang Sect specializes in hidden weapons. If you can master the techniques inside, the power and skill will far surpass that of the Jinghua Finger technique."</p> <p>Xiao Lian listened, deep in thought.</p> <p>From Qin Yi's tone, the Tang Clan's hidden weapons seemed to be far superior to those of the Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>"How long did it take you to practice the 'Jinghua Finger technique' to&#160; small success stage?" Qin Yi suddenly asked.</p> <p>Xiao Lian blinked lightly, replying softly, "One month."</p> <p>"Hmm?"</p> <p>Qin Yi was visibly stunned by this answer, as if she hadn't heard correctly. She asked again, "How long?"</p> <p>"One month." Xiao Lian repeated, puzzled.</p> <p>Ripples appeared in Qin Yi's autumn-like eyes, her breathing becoming noticeably more rapid.</p> <p>One month?</p> <p>How was that possible!</p> <p>Qin Yi had observed that Xiao Lian had no internal energy at all, yet she managed to reach a small success stage with the 'Jinghua Finger technique,' which made her believe Xiao Lian was exceptionally gifted.</p> <p>Without internal energy to support it, achieving such progress should have taken years at the very least.</p> <p>Even for a martial artist with internal energy, reaching a small accomplishment would still require several months of diligent practice.</p> <p>Now Xiao Lian was telling her it only took a month?</p> <p>"Where did you get the 'Jinghua Finger technique'?" Qin Yi took a deep breath, half-doubting and half-believing.</p> <p>Xiao Lian then recounted how she had been abducted a month ago.</p> <p>After listening, Qin Yi pondered deeply, realizing that Xiao Lian probably wasn't lying.</p> <p>She remained silent for a long time before sighing, "What a pity. If only Tang Feng had the Dragon Beard Needle Manual on him."</p> <p>"Otherwise, if I gave it to you, perhaps..."</p> <p>Xiao Lian's bright eyes blinked twice, filled with curiosity.</p> <p>Perhaps what?</p> <p>Qin Yi didn't finish her sentence.</p> <p>"Whether it's the 'Jinghua Finger technique' or the 'Drifting Rain Footwork,' don't reveal these techniques casually. They will bring you trouble."</p> <p>"Take those three manuals back and study them on your own. I will stay in Yuhang County for three days. If you have any questions during these three days, come to Room 1, Ground Floor at the Guesthouse Inn to find me."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"Where do you live?" Qin Yi suddenly asked.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's mouth opened slightly, about to say it, but she swallowed the words "orphanage".</p> <p>She thought of Chen Ye, Da Ming, and Xiao Fu.</p> <p>Qin Yi, after all, is an assassin, and they had just met. She feared it might bring trouble to the orphanage.</p> <p>Considering Qin Yi's ability to appear and disappear, Xiao Lian figured she might already know her residence.</p> <p>"Unwilling to say? It's fine."</p> <p>Qin Yi didn't dwell on the matter.</p> <p>"You saved me today. Without you, I might have died."</p> <p>"Though I'm known as the Yu Luo Sha, I won't harm my savior. You can rest assured."</p> <p>"I will leave Yuhang County in three days to investigate some matters. When I return, I'll come find you."</p> <p>Qin Yi took out a heavy money pouch from her bosom and tossed it to Xiao Lian: "This is 100 taels. Keep it."</p> <p>"If there's nothing else, you may leave."</p> <p>Xiao Lian caught the pouch, bit her lip lightly, and lowered her eyes, whispering, "Thank you, Master."</p> <p>Qin Yi's attitude made her feel a bit guilty.</p> <p>"Being cautious is good. I've said you are a natural-born assassin."</p> <p>Qin Yi seemed to see through Xiao Lian's thoughts, speaking calmly.</p> <p>Xiao Lian bowed and then said, "I will leave now, Master."</p> <p>Her tone was noticeably more respectful.</p> <p>"Mm." Qin Yi's voice remained calm and emotionless.</p> <p>Xiao Lian, with the three manuals and 100 taels of silver in her bosom, retraced her steps back.</p> <p>Once Qin Yi could no longer see Xiao Lian's figure, her autumn-water-like eyes glanced behind her not far away: "You there, come out."</p> <p>A figure dressed in night clothes suddenly appeared twenty meters in front of Qin Yi.</p> <p>The person wore night clothes, their face covered with a mask, making it hard to discern their features, but their figure was slender.</p> <p>Under the moonlight, Qin Yi could sense no malice in the person's eyes.</p> <p>"Who are you?" Qin Yi's beautiful eyes gazed at the figure, her icy inner strength flowing slowly.</p> <p>The figure didn't speak. They looked deeply at Qin Yi before stepping forward.</p> <p>With a flicker of movement, Qin Yi was shocked to see the figure reappear at the street corner, covering a distance of thirty zhang in a single step.</p> <p>Another step and the figure vanished from Qin Yi's sight, as if they had never been there.</p> <p>In the deep night, the summer breeze blew gently, rustling Qin Yi's skirt.</p> <p>Staring at the empty street, a chill crept over Qin Yi's delicate skin, giving her goosebumps.</p> <p>"This footwork..."</p> <p>"Is it human...or ghost..."</p> <p>She whispered softly, feeling her sword-wielding hand grow cold.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>Xiao Lian sneaked into the courtyard and carefully closed the gate behind her.</p> <p>She touched the manuals in her bosom, feeling a mix of emotions.</p> <p>I got it, I really got it.</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked up at the deep night sky, a touch of sadness in her eyes.</p> <p>Mother...</p> <p>I will kill him.</p> <p>Xiao Lian pushed open the door, seeing a small oil lamp burning on the table in the center of the room.</p> <p>The flame flickered gently.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat on a chair, his elbow resting on the table, head drooping as he dozed off.</p> <p>Hearing the door open, Chen Ye opened his sleepy eyes and saw Xiao Lian. He yawned.</p> <p>"Back already?"</p> <p>Chen Ye stood up and headed to his own bedroom. "Try not to go out at night. If the night patrol catches you, it will be troublesome."</p> <p>"I'd have to go to the yamen to get you out."</p> <p>"Get some rest."</p> <p>Chen Ye pushed open his bedroom door and went inside.</p> <p>During this process, he didn't ask Xiao Lian where she had been or what she had done.</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood there, her eyes like a lake disturbed by a stone, causing ripples.</p> <p>Chen Ye lay back on his bed and checked the system information.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Mission Completed: Establish Future Career Path for Orphan (2/2)]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! Reward: 1000 points, 2 orphan skill draw opportunities]</p> <p>[Current points balance: 6172]</p> <p>[Remaining orphan skill draw opportunities: 2]</p> <p>"Sigh, can't she be as simple and ordinary as Da Ming?"</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed lightly, his gaze piercing through the window, looking at the deep night.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Xiao Lian's gratitude has increased!]</p> <p>[Current gratitude level: 67%]</p> <p>The system's cold prompt sounded in Chen Ye's ear.</p> <p>He smirked, snuggling into his blanket, and whispered, "At least she has some conscience."</p> <p>The next day, the weather was clear.</p> <p>After breakfast, Chen Ye placed&#160; Xiaofu in the cradle and sat on a recliner with a suspense novel he had exchanged from the system store. He started reading.</p> <p>When he reached the last page and the mystery was revealed, Chen Ye gritted his teeth and put the book down.</p> <p>"So lame! You keep hinting at ghosts and superstitions, only to reveal it was future technology all along?"</p> <p>Feeling like he had wasted another 50 points, Chen Ye put the book aside.</p> <p>The system store offered many cheap items, but books were exceptionally expensive.</p> <p>"Oh, right, I still have two trait draws left."</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly remembered that he had been rewarded with two trait draw opportunities after completing a mission last night.</p> <p>He thought for a moment and spent another 5000 points to get an additional trait draw opportunity.</p> <p>Now, he had three draw chances in total.</p> <p>After all, points could only be used to exchange for items, and most of them were cheap.</p> <p>After redeeming the draw opportunities, his points balance shrank to 1172.</p> <p>"Let's see what I get with a triple draw."</p> <p>Chen Ye rubbed his hands together, focusing his thoughts.</p> <p>A virtual blue roulette appeared before him, spinning rapidly.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! You've drawn the orphan skill: Fortunate Fate!]</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! You've drawn the orphan skill: Light as a Swallow!]</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host!

Although her background isn't great, I just want her to grow up healthy and safe. That's enough for me."</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at the sleeping Xiao Fu in the cradle. With a thought, he brought up her information panel and assigned the "Fortunate Fate" skill to her.</p> <p>[Name: Chen An'an]</p> <p>[ID: 0003]</p> <p>[Gender: Female]</p> <p>[Age: 1.5 years]</p> <p>[Current Skill: Fortunate Fate]</p> <p>"Safe and sound, living an ordinary life is enough."</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed with some sentiment and looked at the next trait.</p> <p>"I'll give 'Light as a Swallow' to Xiao Lian. Although she has some issues with her temperament, she's a good kid."</p> <p>"She's a killer now, and I don't want her to get caught and killed someday."</p> <p>Chen Ye muttered softly.</p> <p>After a month of living together, Chen Ye had gained a deeper understanding of Xiao Lian.</p> <p>[Name: Xiao Lian]</p> <p>[ID: 0002]</p> <p>[Gender: Female]</p> <p>[Age: 13 years]</p> <p>[Traits: Dexterous, Light as a Swallow]</p> <p>[Current Gratitude Level: 67%]</p> <p>Having assigned two traits, the last one was given to Da Ming.</p> <p>"In this world with martial artists, having more self-defense ability is always a good thing."</p> <p>"Paired with the 'Strong Physique' skill..."</p> <p>"Yes, with increased strength and other abilities improving as well, 'All-round Development' will ensure that even if he encounters martial artists, he won't easily be beaten to death."</p> <p>Chen Ye analyzed and then assigned "All-round Development" to Da Ming.</p> <p>[Name: Chen Da Ming]</p> <p>[ID: 0001]</p> <p>[Gender: Male]</p> <p>[Age: 10 years]</p> <p>[Traits: Strong Physique, Great Wisdom Appears Foolish, All-round Development]</p> <p>[Current Gratitude Level: 80%]</p> <p>After allocating the traits, Chen Ye stood up and stretched his back, muttering, "Being a director really isn't easy, I have to cover all bases..."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

The system is actually upgrading!"</p> <p>"Not bad."</p> <p>[System Upgrade Progress: 10%]</p> <p>[30%]</p> <p>[70%]</p> <p>[90%]</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[System upgrade complete!]</p> <p>A virtual system interface popped up before Chen Ye.</p> <p>[Orphan Cultivation System 2.0]</p> <p>[Host: Chen Ye]</p> <p>[Age: 20]</p> <p>[Points: 1172]</p> <p>[Owned Director Skills: Invulnerability, Shrinking Earth]</p> <p>[Indestructible Body: Nothing in the world can harm your body.]</p> <p>[Ground Shrinking Step: You can reduce a maximum of 100 meters to a single step, appearing at any reachable location, with no cooldown.]</p> <p>[Orphanage Capacity: 3/4 ]</p> <p>[Special Building: Library]</p> <p>Chen Ye noticed that the system interface now included "Orphanage Capacity" and "Special Building" sections at the bottom.</p> <p>"System, what does 3/4 mean?" Chen Ye asked.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>System upgrade details are as follows:]</p> <p>[1. Orphanage capacity indicates the number of orphans that can be adopted.]</p> <p>[Note: Given the host's current level of ability, adopting too many orphans will decrease the quality of cultivation for other orphans.]</p> <p>[2. Introduction of orphan-specific career missions, which will yield substantial points and monetary rewards upon completion.]</p> <p>[Note: Orphans with active career missions will not earn points through daily settlement but will still contribute to daily reports.]</p> <p>[3. Special buildings can now be upgraded.]</p> <p>[Note: Task rewards will include more special buildings.]</p> <p>The system upgrade report was presented.</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered for a moment and understood.</p> <p>"So, it means that I can currently adopt a maximum of four orphans. According to the system, if I adopt too many, the resources will be too scattered, which will affect the growth of the orphans..."</p> <p>"Specific career missions... Does that mean Da Ming and Xiao Lian won't appear in the daily settlement anymore?"</p> <p>"Completing career missions will yield substantial points... The rewards should far exceed daily settlements."</p> <p>"Having more special buildings is fine; Da Ming reads comic books in the library every day and has learned quite a few characters."</p> <p>Chen Ye sat back in the lounge chair as the system's task panel refreshed with three tasks.</p> <p>[Task: Adopt four orphans (3/4)]</p> <p>[Task Reward: 1000 points, 500 taels of silver, one orphan skill draw chance, one special building draw chance]</p> <p>...</p> <p>[Chen Da Ming's Special Task: Woodcutter]</p> <p>[Task Information: Chop down 100 trees]</p> <p>[Task Reward: 5000 points, 200 taels of silver, one exclusive wish item for Chen Da Ming]</p> <p>...</p> <p>[Xiao Lian's Special Task: Assassin]</p> <p>[Task Information: Kill 100 people]</p> <p>[Task Reward: 5000 points, 200 taels of silver, one exclusive wish item for Xiao Lian]</p> <p>...</p> <p>Seeing the task information pop up, Chen Ye gasped.</p> <p>Chop 100 trees, kill 100 people...</p> <p>"System, isn't the difficulty of these tasks a bit unreasonable?"</p> <p>Chen Ye complained.</p> <p>The system did not respond.</p> <p>Cutting trees and killing people are not the same...</p> <p>Chen Ye imagined Xiao Lian standing in front of him after killing a hundred people, exuding murderous intent, and felt a headache coming on.</p> <p>"Forget it, let's take it one step at a time."</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed softly.</p> <p>Raising children is not a task that can be completed overnight; it requires years of effort.</p> <p>...</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, another month passed.</p> <p>Dark clouds gathered together, producing a low rumbling sound.</p> <p>Before long, a heavy downpour began.</p> <p>Raindrops hit the ground, driving away the heat and bringing a refreshing coolness.</p> <p>The time had entered August, different from July, which frequently saw rain, fluctuating between scorching heat and humidity.</p> <p>The weather in Yuhang County had become increasingly stifling, but by the end of August, after the hottest period, it would get cooler.</p> <p>Today, it was rare to see such rain, bringing a refreshing coolness along with the scent of rain on the soil, making people feel at ease.</p> <p>In the room, Chen Ye sat in his lounge chair, eyes closed, listening to the sound of the rain outside, his fingers lightly tapping the chair.</p> <p>In the cradle beside him, Xiao Fu curled up in her small quilt, sleeping soundly.</p> <p>This past month has been peaceful and harmonious, with some changes, but not many.</p> <p>"Plop..."</p> <p>"Plop..."</p> <p>Suddenly, urgent running footsteps sounded in the courtyard, with splashes as someone stepped in puddles.</p> <p>Chen Ye opened his eyes and looked toward the courtyard.</p> <p>A boy wearing a bamboo hat and carrying a small axe on his waist ran in. His short yellow hemp shirt was soaked by the rain, and his straw shoes were muddy.</p> <p>"Da Ming, be quiet, don't wake Xiao Fu," Chen Ye called softly.</p> <p>The boy immediately slowed down and tiptoed into the house. He called out to Chen Ye with a simple grin, "Dad."</p> <p>"Mm," Chen Ye responded.</p> <p>Da Ming was one of the few changes in the orphanage.</p> <p>Because of the frequent need to buy firewood, Chen Ye, Da Ming, and the firewood seller, a man named Zhang Long, gradually became familiar with each other.</p> <p>Zhang Long, who made a living by chopping wood, had two daughters, aged 8 and 6. His wife had suffered complications during childbirth and had not conceived again.</p> <p>Zhang Long had always longed for a son.</p> <p>After getting to know Zhang Long, he saw that Da Ming was strong and interested in chopping wood, and was about the same age as his eldest daughter.</p> <p>So, he suggested that their families become in-laws, with the plan that his daughter would marry Da Ming when she turned 14.</p> <p>Chen Ye met Zhang Long's eldest daughter, who was of average looks, neither beautiful nor ugly, but had a good temperament.</p> <p>After some consideration, Chen Ye agreed to Zhang Long's proposal, and their families became in-laws.</p> <p>Zhang Long was overjoyed and grew even more fond of the honest Da Ming.</p> <p>This past month, he often took Da Ming into the mountains to chop wood, teaching him the skills.</p> <p>Chen Ye learned that most of the wood Zhang Long chopped was sold to the wealthy in the city. Although it was hard work, it was enough to cover the family's expenses.</p> <p>After some thought, Chen Ye decided to let it be, considering it as finding a mentor for Da Ming.</p> <p>Zhang Long, being Da Ming's future father-in-law in name, wouldn't harm him.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't have high expectations for Da Ming, only hoping that he would be able to support himself in the future.</p> <p>Da Ming, with his simple and honest appearance, had someone willing to marry their daughter to him, which made Chen Ye quite satisfied.</p> <p>Among these children, the one Chen Ye was most at ease with was Da Ming.</p> <p>The one he was most worried about was Xiao Lian.</p> <p>This past month, Xiao Lian had been handling the daily life in the orphanage as usual, taking turns with Chen Ye to take care of Xiao Fu.</p> <p>But through the daily reports, Chen Ye knew that Xiao Lian was practicing hidden weapons and internal martial arts every day.</p> <p>After a month, Xiao Lian had already reached the initial stage of martial arts.</p> <p>Her Drifting Rain Footwork had reached a small achievement, and she had started to grasp the basics of Tangmen's hidden weapons.</p> <p>Although Chen Ye didn't know much about martial arts, he understood that such achievements were extraordinary.</p> <p>In Yuhang County, Officer Song, who was in his thirties, had reached the Non-Ordinary Level. Yet in just one month, Xiao Lian had broken through to this level, and that was not to mention her mastery of body techniques and hidden weapons.</p> <p>To be honest, Chen Ye felt a bit envious. Not long ago, he had witnessed Xiao Lian's skill with hidden weapons.</p> <p>While coaxing Xiao Fu, a fly buzzed around. Xiao Lian picked up a fallen leaf from the ground, and with a flick of her fair fingers, the fly was sliced in half by the leaf.</p> <p>Unknowingly, Xiao Lian had become the martial arts master that Chen Ye had always dreamed of!</p> <p>"There's food in the kitchen, go fill your stomach," Chen Ye said, glancing at Da mMng and yawning.</p> <p>Gratitude shone in Da Ming's eyes as he, still wearing his bamboo hat, headed straight to the kitchen.</p> <p>Over the past month, Da Ming and Xiao Lian's progress on their respective missions had been minimal.</p> <p>Da Ming had chopped down only two trees, while Xiao Lian focused solely on her training without taking any lives.</p> <p>Da Ming possessed immense strength, with the physical power of an adult despite being only ten years old. However, his stamina was lacking, requiring frequent breaks while chopping wood. Upon returning, he had a ravenous appetite and ate a lot.</p> <p>Perhaps in a few years, as Da Ming grew older and the effects of his attributes accumulated, his potential would be truly terrifying.</p> <p>Since Da Ming and Xiao Lian no longer contributed to the daily score, Chen Ye's daily points could only come from Xiao Fu, averaging around 30 points a day.</p> <p>After deducting the points used for exchanging books and supplies, Chen Ye's point balance had only reached 1723 after a month.</p> <p>The points were manageable, but what puzzled Chen Ye the most was the gratitude levels.</p> <p>Da Ming's gratitude had risen to 80% but hadn't changed for a month. Xiao Lian's gratitude grew slowly, increasing by only 2% in a month, now at 70%.</p> <p>Perplexed but unable to figure out why, Chen Ye could only blame the system.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Grandmaster!</p> <p>Innate Realm!</p> <p>Hearing the storyteller's answer, the diners were slightly stunned.</p> <p>"So... does that mean the Innate qi skill that Qing Xuzi created is a Grandmaster's martial art?"</p> <p>A young man dressed in short, strong attire muttered quietly.</p> <p>The storyteller picked up his teacup, blew away the dark green tea leaves floating on the surface, revealing the light brown tea inside. He took a sip and said, "Well, that I wouldn't know."</p> <p>"Then, may I ask, Mr. Liu, are there any requirements for Qing Xuzi to accept a disciple?"</p> <p>This time, the speaker was a woman dressed in a green archery outfit. She was robust, with large, calloused hands covered in a thick layer of old skin.</p> <p>"Requirements, huh? Old me wouldn't know that either. Qing Xuzi said all the requirements and rules will be announced at the Iron Sparrow Villa on the seventh day of the month."</p> <p>The storyteller answered in a kind tone.</p> <p>The woman respectfully clasped her fists and said, "Thank you, Mr. Liu."</p> <p>After speaking, she left the Ju Ke Inn without looking back.</p> <p>Other armed martial artists in the hall couldn't contain themselves either and began to leave one after another.</p> <p>Those who were just ordinary diners looked puzzled as they watched this group of martial artists rush out.</p> <p>Suddenly, a middle-aged man dressed as a merchant said, "Iron Sparrow Villa, I think I saw it when I passed through Jiangning Prefecture the year before last."</p> <p>Hearing this, everyone present froze.</p> <p>Chen Ye finished his tea, took out an oil paper package, and wrapped up the leftover peanuts.</p> <p>He stood up from his seat and walked out slowly.</p> <p>As he passed by the people from the Zhenyuan Escort Agency, he heard one of them sneer, "Another one trying to get lucky."</p> <p>Chen Ye walked out of the Ju Ke Inn, and it was still raining outside.</p> <p>In the drizzle, the street resounded with the rapid clopping of hooves. As the horses stepped into puddles, water splashed everywhere.</p> <p>Chen Ye saw a few martial artists who had been listening to the storytelling in the Ju Ke Inn now riding swiftly towards the city gate.</p> <p>He looked up, the edge of his oil paper umbrella blocking out the dim sky.</p> <p>The rain continued to fall steadily.</p> <p>A smile suddenly appeared on Chen Ye's lips, and his eyes seemed to sparkle.</p> <p>"How could I resist joining the excitement after hearing about something related to the martial world?"</p> <p>"Besides, what if I'm really chosen?"</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled slightly and took a step.</p> <p>In the next moment, he appeared at the corner of the street.</p> <p>Another step.</p> <p>Chen Ye's figure disappeared.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked into the courtyard holding an umbrella and heard Xiaofu's indistinct babbling.</p> <p>"Ming..."</p> <p>"Ming..."</p> <p>Walking into the house, Chen Ye saw Da Ming coaxing Xiaofu.</p> <p>Xiaofu's face was full of joy, laughing heartily, utterly delighted.</p> <p>However, Da Ming didn't do anything; he was just smiling dumbly at Xiaofu.</p> <p>Hearing footsteps, Da Ming turned his head and, seeing Chen Ye, called out foolishly, "Dad."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded instinctively.</p> <p>Da Ming had insisted on this and couldn't change it. After calling him that for two months, Chen Ye had also accepted it.</p> <p>"Dad?" Xiaofu's young voice called out from the side.</p> <p>Chen Ye almost lost his composure. "Xiaofu, you should call me Director."</p> <p>"You can't call me Dad."</p> <p>Xiaofu blinked his shiny eyes and started laughing cheerfully.</p> <p>After comforting Xiaofu for a bit, Chen Ye looked at Da Ming, his expression becoming more serious. "Da Ming, I need to go out for a bit."</p> <p>"If things go well, I'll be back in a day."</p> <p>"If it takes longer, I'll definitely be back within three days."</p> <p>"When Xiao Lian comes back, tell her I'll return soon, no need to worry."</p> <p>Da Ming nodded vigorously. "Yes."</p> <p>After Chen Ye gave Da Ming the "Great Wisdom Appears Foolish" attribute, his intelligence had improved significantly.</p> <p>He no longer had that foolish look he had when Chen Ye first met him.</p> <p>After thinking for a moment, Chen Ye walked into the house, pulled out 20 taels of silver from under the bed, and handed it to Da Ming. "If there's an emergency and you need money, use this."</p> <p>"When Xiao Lian comes back, give it to her."</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Oh, and here's a bag of peanuts. You can eat them yourself, but Xiaofu is too young, he can't eat them." Chen Ye stuffed the remaining half-bag of peanuts to Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming's eyes lit up instantly.</p> <p>After giving a few more instructions, Chen Ye glanced at the orphanage, feeling a bit uneasy.</p> <p>He opened the oil-paper umbrella and walked out of the orphanage. The sky was still drizzling.</p> <p>There was a slight chill in the air.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Jiangning Prefecture.</p> <p>The sky was clear, the clouds were light, and the breeze was gentle.</p> <p>The air carried a faint scent of post-rain freshness.</p> <p>Outside Jiangning Prefecture, on the official road.</p> <p>"Come on! Come on!"</p> <p>A gray-brown donkey brayed loudly.</p> <p>It was pulling a cart behind it.</p> <p>"Smack! Smack!"</p> <p>A whip made of rough hemp rope was lashed forcefully on the donkey's back, leaving clear red marks.</p> <p>"Come on! Come on!"</p> <p>The donkey brayed twice but stubbornly stood still.</p> <p>The whip wielder was an old man in rough clothes. He had a fierce expression as he lashed the donkey's back.</p> <p>"Beast! Move!"</p> <p>"You ungrateful beast!"</p> <p>The old man whipped several more times, but the donkey still didn't move.</p> <p>Seeing this, the old man had no choice but to look helplessly at the cart.</p> <p>Five people were sitting on the cart.</p> <p>One was a middle-aged scholar in a purple robe.</p> <p>A man with a bare chest in a yellow short shirt.</p> <p>A woman in a faded blue dress with a light veil over her face.</p> <p>A small blind boy with a black cloth over his eyes.</p> <p>And a young man in black clothing wearing a silver mask with a leaf pattern engraved on the side.</p> <p>The old man, looking embarrassed, turned back to the five people and said, "Sorry everyone, but you know this donkey, once it gets stubborn, even whipping it won't help."</p> <p>"Jiangning Prefecture is just ahead, not far now."</p> <p>"I'll only charge you half the fare for the ride."</p> <p>The old man said this tentatively.</p> <p>Hearing the old man's words, the woman in the faded blue dress with a light veil frowned slightly, glancing at the muddy official road that had just been rained on.</p> <p>The road was full of mud, with various ruts and hoof prints everywhere.</p> <p>She was wearing embroidered cloth shoes, and if she got out of the cart, they would definitely get stuck in the mud and dirty her shoes.</p> <p>"No problem, old sir, the official road is full of mud, and we can't walk well if we get off," said the middle-aged Taoist in the purple robe. His voice was gentle, making people naturally have a good impression of him.</p> <p>The woman's frown relaxed, and she said nothing.</p> <p>"This kind of animal should be beaten to death! When I was in Baoding, donkey meat was a real delicacy," said the big man with a broad chest and a hairy torso, his eyes flashing with a fierce light.</p> <p>The old man's mouth twitched twice, and he smiled, "This donkey is one of the few valuable things my family has. I would be a bit sad to beat it to death."</p> <p>The big man couldn't help but laugh out loud at these words.</p> <p>The old man looked at the remaining two people on the cart.</p> <p>A small blind boy with a black cloth over his eyes and a young man in a silver mask.</p> <p>"What do you two think?" he asked.</p> <p>The small blind boy was sitting on the edge of the cart, swinging his legs. He said cheerfully, "I can't see. If I get off the cart and don't find a kind person, I might never reach Jiangning Prefecture in my lifetime."</p> <p>He expressed his opinion.</p> <p>The old man nodded and looked at the young man in the silver mask.</p> <p>"I'm not in a hurry either," said the young man succinctly, with a hint of indifference in his voice.</p> <p>Seeing that none of the five people on the cart wanted to get off, the old man breathed a sigh of relief.</p> <p>The day before yesterday, something seemed to have happened in Jiangning Prefecture.</p> <p>A large number of outsiders had arrived, their accents and mannerisms different from those of the locals.</p> <p>The old man had vaguely heard from them that something significant was going to happen in Jiangning Prefecture on the fourth of July.</p> <p>So, many outsiders were heading to Jiangning Prefecture.</p> <p>The old man thought it over and decided it was a good opportunity.</p> <p>So, he drove his donkey cart out of Jiangning Prefecture and chose a spot on the official road to specifically pick up outsiders heading into the city.</p> <p>He charged 200 copper coins per person.</p> <p>In the morning, it was raining, and he hadn't picked up many passengers.</p> <p>Now, he had finally gotten some passengers, but the donkey was being stubborn and refused to move.</p> <p>"Ah, this beast! So ungrateful!" the old man sighed, then grew angry and lashed the donkey's back hard with the whip.</p> <p>"Come on! Come on!"</p> <p>The donkey brayed a few times but still didn't move an inch.</p> <p>"Sorry, everyone..." the old man said apologetically.</p> <p>"No problem, this beast doesn't understand human language," said the middle-aged Taoist gently.</p> <p>The man in the yellow short shirt with a bare chest suddenly laughed, "Taoist, why don't you predict when this donkey will move?"</p> <p>"So we don't have to wait in vain."</p> <p>The middle-aged Taoist remained gentle as always. He shook his head and said, "I am not skilled in divination."</p> <p>The man felt a bit disappointed and glanced at the small blind boy sitting on the edge of the cart. "Hey, kid, do you know anything about divination?"</p> <p>"Hehe, what a coincidence," the small blind boy perked up and said, "I have some knowledge of plum blossom divination, six yao, and iron mouth divine judgment!"</p> <p>The people on the cart showed interest.</p> <p>"Alright then, kid, why don't you predict when this donkey will start moving?" The man became interested as the boy engaged in the conversation.</p> <p>The small blind boy shook his head and said, "Divination isn't done casually; it also depends on fate. Doing too much of it can harm my fortune."</p> <p>The man, having seen such tricks before, laughed and said, "Go ahead and divine. If you get it right, I'll pay your fare!"</p> <p>The small blind boy smiled upon hearing this and said, "What a coincidence, fate has come."</p> <p>Everyone on the cart couldn't help but laugh.</p> <p>At this moment, they heard several low horse hooves in the distance. They looked and saw a few riders appear faintly on the southern side of the official road.</p> <p>The small blind boy listened to the sound of the hooves and, after a moment of contemplation, said, "Divination works with movement, not stillness."</p> <p>He raised his right hand, muttering incantations and quickly calculating something.</p> <p>After a moment, he spoke, "Strange, truly strange!"</p> <p>The man with the bare chest asked curiously, "What's strange?"</p> <p>The small blind boy looked hesitant and said, "The divination shows that this donkey won't move."</p> <p>As soon as he finished speaking, the donkey that had stopped suddenly started moving again.</p> <p>It began trotting through the muddy official road, braying as it went, "Hee-haw! Hee-haw!"</p> <p>The man laughed out loud, patting the small blind boy on the shoulder, "You got it right! It's spot on."</p> <p>Feeling the donkey cart start moving, the small blind boy blushed.</p> <p>He murmured to himself, "This shouldn't be..."</p> <p>The small blind boy looked puzzled and troubled, unable to understand.</p> <p>"Kid, next time you predict something, just assume the opposite will happen!" the man laughed heartily.</p> <p>The people on the cart also chuckled.</p> <p>The old man driving the donkey cart lightly whipped the donkey while laughing, "This stubborn beast must have heard the young master's words and got even more stubborn, just to be contrary."</p> <p>The small blind boy remained silent, frowning deeply, still unable to figure it out.</p> <p>"Yah! Yah!"</p> <p>Amid their conversation, the sound of rapid horse hooves approached from behind. The riders were shouting.</p> <p>The people who had been far away on horseback quickly caught up to the donkey cart.</p> <p>As the riders got closer, everyone noticed they were wearing the same yellow-brown brocade garments, with a copper coin embroidered on their chests.</p> <p>There were three men in the group, all looking weather-beaten, as if they had come from a far distance.</p> <p>The sound of the horse hooves was urgent and dense, and their speed was very fast.</p> <p>In contrast, the donkey cart was much slower.</p> <p>Just as the three riders reached the donkey cart, a flash of silver light appeared, chilling and cold.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>On the donkey cart, the man in the purple robe sitting next to the old driver suddenly had a silver short spear in his right hand. The spearhead glinted coldly in the sunlight, thrusting towards one of the three men.</p> <p>The speed was incredibly fast, and the other four people on the cart only saw a flash of silver light. However, just as the purple-robed man's spear was about to strike, the man on horseback, as if having eyes on the back of his head, leaned to the side and narrowly avoided the attack.</p> <p>The expression of the purple-robed man changed, no longer the gentle demeanor from before. His aura transformed, exuding a chilling, intense killing intent. Under this oppressive atmosphere, the donkey pulling the cart stopped, trembling, and a stream of foul-smelling yellow liquid trickled down its legs.</p> <p>The donkey had been scared to the point of urinating.</p> <p>Without hesitation, the purple-robed man stepped on the cart, leaping into the air and landing steadily on the horseback, continuously thrusting his silver short spear. The man who had dodged the first attack jumped from his horse and landed on the horse ahead.</p> <p>At the same time, the other two men leaped into the air, brandishing bright steel knives, attacking the purple-robed man together. This sudden turn of events startled the four people on the donkey cart.</p> <p>The purple-robed man parried their attacks with his silver spear, moving deftly on the horseback. The horse's back, bumpy and unstable, seemed as firm as solid ground under his feet.</p> <p>"Clang! Clang!"</p> <p>The silver spear clashed with the steel knives, sparks flying from their collisions.</p> <p>"What's happening? Why are they fighting?" the blind boy asked anxiously, hearing the sound of weapons clashing.</p> <p>No one responded to him. The old driver, terrified, jumped off the cart and retreated several steps. After a few steps, he looked back at his donkey cart, torn between fleeing and staying.</p> <p>Seeing his two companions being held off by the purple-robed man, the third rider's hands flicked, sending several flying darts towards the purple-robed man. Noticing the incoming projectiles, the purple-robed man quickly pulled out another silver short spear from under his robe and deflected the darts with a few swift moves. One of the deflected darts hit the donkey in the head, causing it to collapse with a pained bray, twitch once, and then lay still.</p> <p>In just a few breaths, the four had exchanged several blows.</p> <p>The blind boy on the cart, hearing the clashing weapons, asked anxiously, "What's happening? What weapons are they using?"</p> <p>The woman in the green robe and the man in the yellow shirt had already jumped off the cart and stood five meters away. The blind boy and the young man in the silver mask were the only ones left on the cart.</p> <p>The man in the silver mask spoke, "The man in the purple robe is using two silver short spears. The other three, two are using knives, and one is using hidden weapons."</p> <p>Upon hearing the situation, the blind boy's face changed dramatically. He muttered to himself, "Two silver spears... two silver spears..."</p> <p>"It must be the Silver Spear, Zhao Wu, the gold-medal assassin from Fengyu Tower!"</p> <p>Upon hearing the name Zhao Wu, the woman in the green robe and the man in the yellow shirt didn't hesitate. They turned and fled towards Jiangning County without looking back. Within a few steps, their shoes were covered in mud. The woman in green no longer cared about keeping her shoes clean, as if the name Zhao Wu, the Silver Spear, was synonymous with the grim reaper or a soul-harvesting demon.</p> <p>The man in the silver mask glanced at the fleeing pair and added, "The other three men are dressed in yellow-brown clothes, with a copper coin embroidered on their chests."</p> <p>"Hiss... They're from the Wan Jin Hall!" The blind boy immediately identified the three men's background.</p> <p>While the two conversed, Zhao Wu, the Silver Spear in a purple robe, moved swiftly, his body agile to the extreme. He leaped over the heads of the two men wielding long knives.</p> <p>Both men shouted and swung their steel knives with great force. In mid-air, Zhao Wu's feet lightly stepped on the two steel knives, using the momentum to propel himself forward.</p> <p>The man on horseback, witnessing this, was filled with dread. Zhao Wu exerted his strength and threw the two silver spears. They shot towards the man who had been using hidden weapons like arrows.</p> <p>The man cried out in surprise, unable to dodge, and the silver spears pierced through his chest and abdomen, killing him instantly. The galloping horse threw the corpse to the ground.</p> <p>Zhao Wu lightly landed beside the corpse and pulled out the silver spears. The man's body twitched, and two streams of warm blood sprayed out, staining Zhao Wu's purple robe. The air filled with the scent of blood, but Zhao Wu's expression remained unchanged as he coldly eyed the remaining two men from the Wan Jin Hall.</p> <p>The two men with steel knives looked at Zhao Wu in fear and uncertainty. The blind boy, smelling the blood in the air, turned pale and asked, "Is someone dead?"</p> <p>"Who died?"</p> <p>"The one from the Wan Jin Hall who used hidden weapons," the man in the silver mask replied, his voice tinged with excitement, as if watching the fight had satisfied his curiosity.</p> <p>The blind boy sighed in relief. "Good, good. The men from the Wan Jin Hall aren't very strong."</p> <p>"Why? Do you favor Zhao Wu, the Silver Spear?" the silver-masked man asked curiously.</p> <p>The blind boy shook his head. "It's not about favoring; it's that the men from the Wan Jin Hall deserve their fate."</p> <p>The two remaining men glared angrily at the blind boy. One of them shouted, "Aren't you going to help?"</p> <p>The blind boy shivered and turned to the man in the silver mask with a look of terror.</p> <p>The man in the silver mask tried to touch his nose, but his fingers only brushed against the mask. "It wasn't me," he said.</p> <p>Zhao Wu, standing beside the corpse, frowned and looked at everyone present.</p> <p>The man in the silver mask turned his head to the old man standing nearby who hadn't left. The old man's face was pale, and his legs were trembling. He shook his head and said, "It... it wasn't me either..."</p> <p>The atmosphere suddenly grew tense, and everyone exchanged uneasy glances.</p> <p>At that moment, Zhao Wu suddenly lunged forward, but then he was flung back like a kite with its string cut. He tumbled on the ground a few times, tapped his feet rapidly, and managed to put some distance between him and the others before vomiting a mouthful of blood.</p> <p>Where Zhao Wu had been standing, there was now a new figure. The man was burly, wearing a short yellow hemp shirt, revealing a hairy chest, and was looking at everyone with a smile.</p> <p>The blind boy, unable to see, quickly asked, "What's happening?"</p> <p>"The guy who asked you for a fortune earlier seems to be a helper from the Wan Jin Hall. He walked without a sound and just hit Zhao Wu so hard he spat blood," the man in the silver mask explained, narrating the situation to the blind boy.</p> <p>"Walking without a sound... one hit and spitting blood..." The blind boy thought for a moment, then suddenly shuddered and asked in a deep voice, "Is that man bare-chested, burly, and smiling?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>"Damn, it's the Twelfth Master of the Wan Jin Hall, Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin! Zhao Wu is doomed," the blind boy declared with certainty. After speaking, his face turned dark, and he muttered quietly, "Bad luck, bad luck, why did I have to run into this guy as soon as I came down the mountain..."</p> <p>The blind boy reached into his pocket, pulling out three copper coins, and quickly shook them in his hand, mumbling incantations as he did so.</p> <p>Zhao Wu, who had been struck and was now pale as a sheet, showed a look of despair upon hearing the name Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin.</p> <p>"This can't be... why are you here?" he asked.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, still smiling, replied, "Why shouldn't I be here?"</p> <p>"Qing Xuzi is choosing a successor; no one said I couldn't come."</p> <p>Zhao Wu stared at Xu Xiaolin, recalling all the strange things that had happened earlier. How could a foolproof sneak attack be avoided by a mere third-grade martial artist? Combined with Xu Xiaolin's presence, it was clear the enemy was well-prepared.</p> <p>Zhao Wu trembled and looked at Xu Xiaolin with terror. "You're here to kill me?"</p> <p>"Oh? You're smart! It seems your Fengyu Tower assassins have figured it out," Xu Xiaolin said, still smiling.</p> <p>Zhao Wu's chest heaved rapidly, his face contorted. Gritting his teeth, he asked, "So it's true... But why?"</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin's smile remained as he replied, "Blame it on your Fengyu Tower being too conspicuous."</p> <p>After saying that, Xu Xiaolin looked at the blind boy and teased, "Blind boy, have you figured it out? Will you survive today?"</p> <p>Compared to Zhao Wu, who had been left with half his life after taking a blow, Xu Xiaolin seemed more interested in the blind boy. Despite being blind, the boy had accurately identified Xu Xiaolin's identity, proving he was no ordinary person.</p> <p>The blind boy had just finished shaking the copper coins for the last time. He touched the patterns on the coins, discerning the final changes in the divination. He let out a sigh of relief and murmured quietly, "Good, good, a narrow escape!"</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, hearing the boy's muttering, burst into laughter. "Well, then you're doomed. Didn't I tell you that the divination readings should be interpreted in reverse?"</p> <p>"This means certain death!"</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the blind boy's face turned deathly pale.</p> <p>The man in the silver mask, still seated on the donkey cart, curiously asked, "What grade is Zhao Wu?"</p> <p>The blind boy glanced in his direction and replied, "Mid-second grade."</p> <p>"And what about this Smiling Cat, Xu Xiaolin?"</p> <p>"Second-grade peak."</p> <p>"Is the difference that big?" The man in the silver mask seemed unaware of the martial world's intricacies and asked with a puzzled expression.</p> <p>The blind boy's mouth twitched slightly. "If it were someone else, Zhao Wu might have a chance. But against Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin, who is renowned for his lightness skill, there's no way he'll survive."</p> <p>"His steps are silent because he's mastered a second-grade lightness skill to perfection. It's so flawless that it's almost unbeatable! Except for first-grade experts who can sense his movements, no one below that level can escape him."</p> <p>The blind boy's expression darkened. "If you're not a first-grade expert specializing in lightness skills, catching up to him is nearly impossible."</p> <p>"Oh? That impressive?" The man in the silver mask appeared genuinely surprised, his interest piqued. "What's the name of this sinister lightness skill?"</p> <p>"It's called 'Cat Steps,' created by a lama from the Western Regions. Xu Xiaolin earned the nickname Smiling Cat because of it."</p> <p>On the donkey cart, the blind boy and the man in the silver mask continued chatting as if they had nothing to worry about, completely ignoring Xu Xiaolin.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin's expression darkened, and he sneered, "You seem to know quite a lot."</p> <p>The man in the silver mask glanced at Xu Xiaolin, noticing the smile frozen on his face, and suddenly realized, "Ah, I see now! His smile comes from that constant smirk on his face, right?"</p> <p>"Indeed," the blind boy responded in a scholarly tone.</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Xu Xiaolin's face twitched. Whether he smiled or not, he was caught in an awkward position. He glared coldly at the man in the silver mask. "Who are you?"</p> <p>"Have you also calculated whether you'll survive?"</p> <p>The man in the silver mask chuckled, slightly bowed, and said, "I am who I am,and I'm not ashamed, name's Donghua."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye removed the radical components of his name and came up with the alias "Donghua."</p> <p>Although he claimed to be someone who doesn't change his name or identity, when it comes to wandering the Jianghu (martial world), who really uses their real name?</p> <p>Starting from Yuhang County, Chen Ye jogged for over two thousand steps and reached the outskirts of Jiangning Prefecture.</p> <p>Covering over a hundred kilometers in less than five minutes, using his technique of Ground Shrinking Step, he could traverse 100 meters in a single step without any cooldown. His speed was astonishingly fast.</p> <p>As he approached Jiangning County, Chen Ye stopped using Ground Shrinking Step. With plenty of time, he decided to enjoy the scenery along the way.</p> <p>Walking at a regular pace, he noticed that the area around Jiangning Prefecture had just experienced a rainfall. The air was fresh, and the scenery was beautiful. He exchanged some points in the system's shop for a silver mask to cover his face, and it wasn't long before he encountered an old man with a donkey cart offering rides.</p> <p>When Chen Ye revealed his alias, everyone present was deep in thought.</p> <p>They had never heard of the name "Donghua."</p> <p>Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin had no impression of this name in his memory, which led him to believe that this was likely a nobody.</p> <p>"A nobody dares to boast?"</p> <p>"You really don't know the meaning of the word 'death.'"</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin sneered coldly, and in a movement as agile as a cat, his burly figure suddenly leaped towards the donkey cart.</p> <p>With a loud "smash!" the donkey cart that the blind boy and Chen Ye were sitting on was split in two by Xu Xiaolin's palm.</p> <p>"Huh?"</p> <p>Seeing that his strike had missed, Xu Xiaolin's expression changed drastically.</p> <p>"Close call, close call. That almost hit me." Chen Ye and the blind boy suddenly appeared about twenty thirty feet away.</p> <p>Chen Ye put down the blind boy, a layer of cold sweat forming on his back. If he had reacted just a bit slower, he might have taken that hit.</p> <p>Even though he had the [Indestructible Body] ability, Chen Ye wasn't about to take a hit for nothing.</p> <p>Taking a hit without retaliating would be demeaning, especially if he planned to establish the "Donghua" persona in the Jianghu (martial world).</p> <p>He couldn't let people think of Donghua as merely someone who could take a beating.</p> <p>The blind boy shook his head, feeling like he had been moved to another location. He asked in confusion, "What happened? What's going on?"</p> <p>Chen Ye laughed and replied, "A little cat's punch missed."</p> <p>Hearing this, the blind boy was momentarily stunned, then showed a strange expression.</p> <p>To describe the famously formidable "Smiling Cat" Xu Xiaolin in such a way---this "Donghua" was likely the first person to do so.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, having missed his strike, looked grim. He observed the position of Chen Ye and the blind boy.</p> <p>When he saw them appear twenty thirty feet away, his expression completely changed.</p> <p>"Who are you, really?" Xu Xiaolin asked in a low voice, dropping his smile and becoming incredibly serious.</p> <p>A laugh came from behind the silver mask: "Didn't I tell you already? Didn't you understand?"</p> <p>Chen Ye's voice was calm, with a hint of a smile, as if he didn't take the top-tier second grade master Smiling cat Xu Xiaolin seriously at all.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye and the blind boy suddenly appear twenty thirty feet away, Zhao Wu, who was injured, widened his eyes in shock.</p> <p>The two other men from the Wan Jin Hall were equally astonished.</p> <p>To cover twenty thirty feet in an instant with such lightness skill was unheard of!</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin reflected on his abilities, realizing that even if he exerted his full strength, he could only cover about ten feet.</p> <p>Even a top-tier expert specializing in lightness skills would be hard-pressed to cross twenty feet.</p> <p>But this Donghua had crossed twenty thirty feet in an instant!</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin now felt a chill in his limbs.</p> <p>If this person were to launch a sneak attack...</p> <p>I would have been dead already!</p> <p>Everyone present fell silent, staring blankly at Chen Ye.</p> <p>"What's wrong? Why is no one speaking?" the blind boy, unaware that Chen Ye had just pulled him across twenty thirty feet, asked in confusion.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin took a deep breath, the smile on his face completely fading. He solemnly cupped his hands towards Chen Ye and asked, "Sir, this matter doesn't concern you. Do you really intend to get involved?"</p> <p>Chen Ye, with a faint smile, responded, "When did I say I was getting involved?"</p> <p>Hearing this, Xu Xiaolin couldn't help but show a hint of joy.</p> <p>Judging by the opponent's mastery of lightness skills, he knew this person was anything but ordinary.</p> <p>He had only acted to eliminate Zhao Wu.</p> <p>If this silver-masked man were to interfere, things could get complicated.</p> <p>Thee blind boy, hearing the conversation between the two, trembled and exclaimed, "You!"</p> <p>"Is it you that the divination predicted would survive against all odds?"</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled, "Oh? Is it me?"</p> <p>The blind boy noticed that Chen Ye's voice carried no trace of panic---only calm confidence.</p> <p>He couldn't help but laugh, "Interesting, interesting!"</p> <p>"I knew my luck wouldn't be that bad."</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin realized that Chen Ye had no intention of getting involved in the conflict between Fengyu Tower and Wan Jin Hall. He turned his attention back to the injured Zhao Wu, his face once again adopting that of a smiling tiger.</p> <p>Zhao Wu, clutching his chest with one hand, looked pale as paper, his breathing erratic.</p> <p>The palm strike from Xu Xiaolin just now was infused with immense internal energy.</p> <p>The full-force strike from a Second-grade peak expert had already injured him.</p> <p>Had Xu Xiaolin not primarily focused on lightness skills, making his palm technique somewhat lacking, that strike would have been fatal if executed by any other Second-grade peak expert.</p> <p>"Wan Jin Hall, Fengyu Tower will avenge me," Zhao Wu coughed up another mouthful of blood, his eyes dim, devoid of any will to live.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin chuckled, "I'd like to see how you plan to get your revenge."</p> <p>He hunched slightly, his back arched in a peculiar posture, and like an agile cat, he lunged at Zhao Wu.</p> <p>In an instant, he crossed over ten feet, appearing right in front of Zhao Wu.</p> <p>Zhao Wu stomped both feet, leaping toward the two Wan Jin Hall members holding steel blades.</p> <p>Even if he were to die, he intended to take two others down with him.</p> <p>"Coward," Xu Xiaolin sneered, his footsteps silent as he ghosted behind Zhao Ling.</p> <p>At that moment, Zhao Wu suddenly spun around, wielding two silver short spears, thrusting them upward and downward, striking viciously at Xu Xiaolin.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin's heart tightened. He abruptly halted his advance, leaping three feet into the air to evade the lower spear.</p> <p>His nimble feet landed on the tip of the upper spear.</p> <p>Just then, a ruthless glint flashed in Zhao Wu's eyes.</p> <p>He abandoned the spears, his palms shooting skyward in a rapid attack aimed at Xu Xiaolin.</p> <p>With Xu Xiaolin airborne and unable to dodge, he formed circular motions with his palms, meeting Zhao Wu's attack head-on.</p> <p>As their palms connected, Zhao Wu's stance shifted---it had been a feint.</p> <p>His feet moved quickly as he employed his lightness skill, darting towards Chen Ye, who was watching from nearby.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin was both furious and shocked, realizing that Zhao Wu's desperate act had been a ruse.</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed, feeling a bit helpless. "You're running towards me, but I can't save you."</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin quickly recovered, his feet barely touching the ground before he lunged forward.</p> <p>"Honored sir, I beg you, deliver a message to Fengyu Tower!"</p> <p>"The Earthly Branches have changed!"</p> <p>Zhao Wu sprinted towards Chen Ye, shouting in a pleading tone.</p> <p>Just as he finished speaking, Xu Xiaolin caught up and struck him in the back with a powerful palm. Blood sprayed out as Zhao Wu died on the spot.</p> <p>Zhao Wu, dressed in a purple Daoist robe, slowly collapsed to the ground, his chest stained with blood.</p> <p>His bulging eyes stared straight at Chen Ye, filled with a desperate plea.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye witnessed someone being killed right in front of him, with blood splattering everywhere. It was a shocking and unsettling experience. As a modern person, he had never seen anything like this before.</p> <p>Earlier, when Zhao Wu killed that member of the Wan Jin Hall, it happened too quickly for Chen Ye to fully grasp. But now, seeing Zhao Wu, who had just been pleading for his help, killed in the next moment, filled Chen Ye with a sense of sorrow.</p> <p>The martial world wasn't as grand as he had imagined; its true face was one of blood and killing.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, after striking Zhao Wu to death, still maintained his smiling expression, as if he had just killed a chicken or crushed an ant. Seeing Xu Xiaolin's smiling face sent a chill down Chen Ye's spine.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin looked at Chen Ye and, still smiling, said, "Sir, about what was just said... how much will it take for you to forget it?"</p> <p>Chen Ye snapped out of his thoughts and responded coldly, "Oh? Are you that wealthy?"</p> <p>Hearing this, the people present all had peculiar expressions on their faces, as if Chen Ye had made a common mistake that everyone else knew better about.</p> <p>The little blind boy beside him pondered for a moment and then said, "Wan Jin Hall... Why is it called 'Wan Jin'?"</p> <p>"It's said that Wan Jin Hall's wealth surpasses that of any nation. Their riches are unmatched."</p> <p>"Most of the merchants in the Great Wu Dynasty have connections with Wan Jin Hall."</p> <p>After saying this, the little blind boy added with a smile, "However, Wan Jin Hall rarely buys things with money."</p> <p>"But if they are willing to pay for something, it must be priceless."</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin's eyes slightly changed, but his smile remained as he looked at Chen Ye and asked, "What does sir think?"</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled and looked at the little blind man beside him, asking, "So, Wan Jin Hall is quite powerful?"</p> <p>"Very powerful," the little blind boy answered seriously.</p> <p>"And they have a lot of money?"</p> <p>"Very rich."</p> <p>"So, how much do you think I should ask for?"</p> <p>Instead of responding to Xu Xiaolin, Chen Ye continued his conversation with the little blind boy.</p> <p>"At least 1,000 taels of gold. If Wan Jin Hall is willing to pay for something, it must be extremely valuable," the little blind boy suggested with a grin.</p> <p>"Four words, 1,000 taels of gold?" Chen Ye asked in surprise.</p> <p>1,000 taels of gold were equivalent to 10,000 taels of silver, which had a purchasing power of about 5 million. Four words for 5 million---this price was truly astounding.</p> <p>"Even that might be too little," the little blind boy replied seriously.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin couldn't help but twitch at the corners of his mouth as he listened to the back-and-forth between Chen Ye and the little blind man. 1,000 taels of gold---such audacity!</p> <p>"Sir, 100 taels of gold in exchange for you forgetting those four words. Consider it a favor, and in the future, if you encounter anyone from Wan Jin Hall, just mention my name, Xu Xiaolin," Xu Xiaolin said, retracting his smile and clasping his hands together in a gesture of respect.</p> <p>"What do you think of this price?" Chen Ye asked the little blind boy with a smile.</p> <p>The little blind boy leaned closer and whispered, "It's about right. 100 taels of gold isn't a small amount, even for the head of Wan Jin Hall."</p> <p>"Killing a late-stage third-rank expert in Fengyu Tower only earns 200 taels of gold."</p> <p>"Four words worth 100 taels of gold---that's quite enough."</p> <p>Chen Ye quickly did some calculations in his head.</p> <p>100 taels of gold were equivalent to 1,000 taels of silver. So, the life of a late-stage third-rank expert was worth 2,000 taels of silver, which was about 1 million in purchasing power?</p> <p>Tsk, tsk...</p> <p>Chen Ye now had a deeper understanding of the power levels in this world.</p> <p>As Chen Ye pondered, the little blind boy tugged at his sleeve and whispered, "Are you afraid of Wan Jin Hall?"</p> <p>"Of course not," Chen Ye smiled.</p> <p>With [Ground Shrinking Step] and [Indestructible Body], he feared no one.</p> <p>"Then make a tough bargain. Ask for 200 taels of gold; Xu Xiaolin will most likely give it to you," the little blind boy suggested. "If he's willing to offer 100 taels of gold, it means those four words are definitely worth more."</p> <p>Chen Ye understood and looked at Xu Xiaolin, speaking calmly, "200 taels of gold."</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin's eyelids twitched, and his face immediately darkened, but he quickly resumed his usual smiling expression. Without hesitation, he pulled out 20 gold notes from his pocket.</p> <p>"I hope you will keep your word."</p> <p>With that, Xu Xiaolin waved the gold notes, and one of the knife-wielding gang members stepped forward to take the notes and handed them to Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye accepted the gold notes, squinting slightly.</p> <p>200 taels of gold?</p> <p>He exchanged four words for 200 taels of gold?</p> <p>This money came too easily, didn't it?</p> <p>"Sir, until we meet again," Xu Xiaolin said with a smile.</p> <p>He gave a slight bow, then turned and left with the other two gang members, heading in the direction of Jiangning County. It was evident he wasn't there to participate in the selection of Qing Xuzi's successor.</p> <p>Chen Ye counted the gold notes in his hand, feeling a bit unreal.</p> <p>"They left?" the little blind man asked nervously.</p> <p>"They're gone," Chen Ye replied, his tone still calm.</p> <p>The little blind boy sighed in relief, muttering, "Good, good, they're gone."</p> <p>He "looked" toward Chen Ye with a mischievous grin and asked, "Did they really give you 200 taels?"</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at the little blind boy, smiled, and pulled out a 10-tael gold note, handing it to him. "Consider it a broker's fee."</p> <p>"No, you saved my life; consider this a payment for that," the little blind boy shook his head vigorously, as if he had principles he wouldn't compromise.</p> <p>Chen Ye put away the gold note without insisting further.</p> <p>"Do you know a lot about the martial world?" Chen Ye began to show interest in the little blind boy.</p> <p>"I know a little," the little blind boy said modestly, baring his teeth in a grin.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at the disordered road and asked, "Are you heading to the Iron Sparrow Villa as well?"</p> <p>"Yes, but I'm going to find someone, not to participate in that selection." The little blind boy shook his head and, as if remembering something, added, "That selection was decided long ago. Going there is just a waste of time."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the little blind boy in surprise. He knew quite a lot.</p> <p>"Then let's go together," Chen Ye suggested.</p> <p>He was eager to learn more about the martial world of the Great Wu Dynasty and needed someone like the little blind boy to explain things to him.</p> <p>The little blind boy was delighted, feeling lucky. Following someone who could scare off Xu Xiaolin meant his safety was practically guaranteed.</p> <p>Master, master, my luck is just too good, the little blind boy thought happily.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Outside Jiangning County.</p> <p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy arrived at the city gates. The soldiers responsible for inspecting people stood lazily nearby, looking at the armed martial artists with impatience and annoyance.</p> <p>A large sign hung beside the soldiers, stating that entry to the city cost 40 copper coins per person.</p> <p>"Little blind boy, what's your name?" Chen Ye asked as they moved with the crowd toward the city gate, paying the entry fee for both of them.</p> <p>The little blind boy, holding a long stick, tapped the ground as he walked, his head swaying as he said, "My name is Tian Jizi!"</p> <p>Tian Jizi?</p> <p>The name was quite unique, sounding like a Taoist title.</p> <p>As they entered Jiangning County, the streets were filled with armed martial artists, both men and women, young and old. It was clear from their demeanor that they had come to participate in the selection for Qing Xuzi's successor.</p> <p>"Mr. Donghua, are you here to participate in the selection as well?" Tian Jizi asked, tilting his head.</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled and replied, "Just to take a look, mostly to broaden my knowledge. The martial world of the Great Wu Dynasty is a bit different from what I imagined."</p> <p>"That's great, Mr. Hua! If you come across any unfamiliar sects, just ask me!" Tian Jizi proudly thumped his chest, promising, "I basically know all the sects and notable figures in the martial world."</p> <p>"Good, I'll rely on you then, Brother Tian!" Chen Ye responded, playing along.</p> <p>Hearing this, Tian Jizi chuckled, a bit embarrassed.</p> <p>"By the way, Mr. Hua, we should hurry to book a room at an inn. If we wait any longer, we might end up sleeping on the streets tonight," Tian Jizi said, suddenly remembering something.</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded.</p> <p>Jiangning County was full of martial artists coming for Qing Xuzi's selection tomorrow, so he wasn't sure if there were any rooms left.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>At the end of the long street, in front of a building, stood a wooden pole of three or four feet, with four fiery red lanterns hanging on it, with four big characters written on it.</p> <p><strong>"Longmen Inn."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye felt a little complicated when he saw these four characters.</p> <p><em>"Is there really an inn with this name?"</em> He complained in his heart and walked into the inn with Tian Jizi.</p> <p>As soon as the two entered the inn, the waiter standing in front of the counter came up to greet them.</p> <p>"Two guests, our store only has the Ren rooms left, 10 taels of silver per night."</p> <p>Hearing this price, Chen Ye was stunned for a moment.</p> <p><em>"Good guy, this price is catching up with the price of a night's rest in Yihong Brothel back at Yuhang County!"</em></p> <p>The waiter&#8217;s look seemed to say, <em>"That&#8217;s the price, take it or leave it."</em></p> <p>When he saw the clothes of Chen Ye and the little blind boy, he guessed that the two must not have much money.</p> <p>"Quite normal, quite normal..." The little blind boy muttered a few words, fumbled in his arms for a while, took out a silver note of 10 taels of silver, and handed it to the waiter.</p> <p>The waiter was stunned when he saw that the two could really take out 10 taels of silver. He reacted quickly, took the banknote, and immediately changed his face.</p> <p>Then he pulled the rag on his shoulder and shouted enthusiastically, "Honored guests, please come this way!"</p> <p>Chen Ye followed the waiter into the store with an expressionless face.</p> <p><em>"There is no lack of people like this in any era, this is normal."</em></p> <p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy walked into the inn. In the center of the lobby of the inn, there were guests sitting at several tables. From their clothes and weapons at hand, it was not difficult to see that they were all warriors.</p> <p>Chen Ye only took a glance and then retracted his gaze.</p> <p>Going up to the second floor, the waiter took Chen Ye and the little blind boy to the Ren room.</p> <p>Pushing open the door, the room was a little small, with a bed on each side of the east and west, and a wooden table and two chairs in the middle of the room. Apart from this, there was nothing else.</p> <p>The conditions were very poor, but there was no other option.</p> <p><em>"Creek..."</em></p> <p>The door of the Ren room next door was pushed open.</p> <p>"Waiter, give me a bowl of Yangchun noodles and send it to the room."</p> <p>A woman in a black skirt and holding a sword in her left hand stood in front of the door and said to the waiter. There was a hint of gracefulness in her plain voice.</p> <p>Chen Ye was slightly stunned when he saw the other party, and the corners of his mouth curled slightly under the mask.</p> <p>"Okay, wait a moment!" The waiter responded.</p> <p>He handed the room key and smilingly said to Chen Ye, "Sir, call me if you have anything."</p> <p>Chen Ye hummed, took another look at the woman in the black dress, and went into the room with the little blind boy.</p> <p>After closing the door, the little blind boy laughed and said, "The one who just spoke must be a beauty."</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't help but laugh, "You can't see, but you know that the other party is a beauty?"</p> <p>"Tsk tsk, Master Hua, you don't know this. Although I can't see with my eyes, I can see it clearly in my heart."</p> <p>"Even if she doesn&#8217;t speak to me, as long as I walk past her, I can tell whether she is beautiful, ugly, fat, or thin."</p> <p>Chen Ye arched his hands, "You are amazing, I wonder how old Brother Tian is this year?"</p> <p>"Fourteen." The little blind boy smiled.</p> <p>Only 14, still a little kid.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't expose the other party. He sat on the chair, closed his eyes slightly, tapped the table, and thought about the woman in the black dress and Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't want to care about it, but the woman in the black dress and Xiao Lian had a master-disciple relationship.</p> <p>"Brother Tian, how much do you know about Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly opened his eyes and asked.</p> <p>The little blind boy lying on the bed chuckled and said, "I know a lot about it."</p> <p>"Fengyu Tower is the top assassin organization in the Dawu Dynasty, and its intelligence network covers the entirety of Dawu."</p> <p>"It is said they even know if it is windy or rainy at a certain place as soon as it happens."</p> <p>"No one knows how their intelligence network works, but they are very scary."</p> <p>"They are very powerful. There are no less than thirty second-grade gold medal assassins in the tower."</p> <p>"There are even hundreds of third and fourth-grade assassins."</p> <p>"Anyone targeted by them will basically have no choice but to die."</p> <p>Chen Ye asked, "Thirty second-grade masters! Is Fengyu Tower really that powerful?"</p> <p>The little blind boy sat up and said seriously, "Very much so."</p> <p>"The five sword sects of the Five Mountains, Huashan, Songshan, Taishan, North Hengshan, and South Hengshan, add up to no more than thirty second-grade masters."</p> <p>"No one knows how Fengyu Tower cultivated those masters. They seemed to have appeared out of thin air.&#8221; The little blind boy said in an amazed tone.</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded and had some understanding of the strength of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>"It can be said that Wanjin Hall and Fengyu Tower are the organizations that should not be provoked in the martial arts world."</p> <p>"If they fight, I'm afraid many people will die.&#8221;</p> <p>At this point, the little blind boy's voice was a little emotional, with a hint of compassion in his tone.</p> <p>"Which one has a better reputation, Wanjin Hall or Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly asked.</p> <p>The little blind boy sneered twice, "Neither of them are good people, but in comparison, Fengyu Tower is more open."</p> <p>"Oh? What do you mean?"</p> <p>"Wanjin Hall looks glorious on the surface, but there are many more dirty things behind the scenes than Fengyu Tower."</p> <p>"Fengyu Tower is more open than most of the sects in the martial arts world. As for those famous and upright sects..."</p> <p>The little blind boy's tone changed, and he said sarcastically, "They are filled with nonsense like senior brothers, junior sisters, disciples, and sect wives."</p> <p>From the tone, it could be heard that the little blind boy seemed to be very ashamed of the famous and upright sects.</p> <p>After listening, Chen Ye tapped the table twice, thinking in his heart.</p> <p><em>"Xiaolian, Xiaolian, tell me, what kind of profession did you choose&#8230;"</em></p> <p><em>"Why did you choose a killer when you could choose anything else?"</em></p> <p>After asking about the situation in Fengyu Tower, Chen Ye made a decision in his heart.</p> <p>He smiled at the little blind boy and said, "Brother Tian, do you want to judge that beauty who we just saw?"</p> <p>Meanwhile, Qin Yi placed the long sword on the table. In front of her was a bowl of Yangchun noodles. A few chopped green onions were sprinkled on the snow-white noodles, and a little oil was floating on the noodle soup.</p> <p>Qin Yi slowly took off the black veil, revealing a fair and delicate face, with light-colored skin and delicate contours.</p> <p>A pair of autumn water-like eyes cradled below curved willow eyebrows blinked, looking around. Her high nose complemented her plump and round rosy lips.</p> <p>The features gave people an impression of graceful and gentle temperament. Anyone who saw this face would probably not believe that its owner was a female assassin who killed without blinking.</p> <p>Compared with an assassin, this face was more like a woman who was raised in the boudoir in Jiangnan Water Town.</p> <p>Just as Qin Yi picked up her chopsticks and clamped up some noodles, she heard several knocks on the door.</p> <p>She placed down the chopsticks, put on the veil again, grabbed her long sword, and walked to the door.</p> <p>A silver mask with leaf patterns on the edge appeared in front of her.</p> <p>"What do you want, sir?" Qin Yi asked calmly.</p> <p>A faint laugh came from behind the silver mask:</p> <p>"I met a friend named Zhao on the road. He wields two silver spears and is very good at qinggong. Before he died, he asked a friend of mine to pass a message to Fengyu Tower."</p> <p>Qin Yi's pupils shrank.</p> <p>"Please come in and talk."</p> <p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy walked into Qin Yi's room. When passing by, Chen Ye smelled a faint fragrance of osmanthus from the woman in the black dress next to him.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy walked into the room.</p> <p>Qin Yi keenly felt that the two had no martial arts skills, and a strange feeling rose in her heart. She narrowed her beautiful eyes and suddenly realized something.</p> <p><em>How did these two people know that she was from Fengyu Tower?</em></p> <p>The identity of the assassins in Fengyu Tower was secret, and no portrait had ever been leaked. Only the characteristics of martial arts and weapons were circulated in the world.</p> <p>After Chen Ye entered the room, he sat down on the chair naturally. Seeing a pot of tea on the wooden table, he poured a cup of tea.</p> <p>The little blind boy next to him turned pale as soon as he entered the room, as if he knew the identity of the woman in the black dress.</p> <p>Qin Yi closed the door and said in a flat voice, <strong>"What did Zhao Wu say?"</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye picked up the teacup, took a sip, and smiled, <strong>"I don't know. Wanjin Hall gave me 200 taels of gold and asked me to forget that sentence. I am trustworthy and will not break my promise, so I can't remember it.</strong></p> <p><strong>But the friend who uses silver spears seemed to say to my little brother before he died, asking him to pass on a message. Ask him."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye threw the topic to the little blind boy.</p> <p>Qin Yi looked at the little blind boy, then moved her eyes to Chen Ye. These two people were very strange.</p> <p>The little blind boy took a deep breath and said in a trembling voice, <strong>"He only said four words; &#8216;Earthly branches have changed&#8217;."</strong></p> <p>Hearing this, Qin Yi's expression changed drastically, and her pupils shrank into a needle.</p> <p><strong>"Sure enough..."</strong> Qin Yi murmured in an inaudible voice.</p> <p>She quickly regained her composure and clasped her fists together in a gesture of gratitude toward Chen Ye and the little blind boy.</p> <p><strong>"Thank you both!"</strong></p> <p>After a moment of thought, Qin Yi added, <strong>"This sentence is of great significance. Do you have any enemies? I am willing to kill them for you..."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye's mouth twitched twice.</p> <p><em>Is this how the assassins of Fengyu Tower work? The way to repay a favor is to kill someone for someone else?</em></p> <p></p> <p>He still preferred the way of Wanjin Hall.</p> <p><strong>"No need, we are all children of the rivers and lakes (Jianghu), and we should repay our love and hatred with our own hands."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye drank the tea in his cup, stood up, and bowed.</p> <p><strong>"I have delivered the message, goodbye."</strong></p> <p>After speaking, Chen Ye did not stop. He took the little blind boy out of the room and returned to their own room next door.</p> <p>As soon as he entered, the little blind boy jumped onto the bed, his teeth chattering. He hugged himself and muttered, <strong>"It's her... It's her..."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye was puzzled. <strong>"Who is she?"</strong></p> <p><strong>"Yu Luosha, the gold medal killer of Fengyu Tower!"</strong></p> <p><strong>"Is she famous?"</strong></p> <p>The little blind boy knew that this mysterious Mr. Donghua seemed to know very little about the world, so he explained,</p> <p><strong>"Although her strength is in the middle stage of the second rank, her status in Fengyu Tower is different.</strong></p> <p><strong>She is the direct disciple of the owner of Fengyu Tower! She had a strange encounter when she was young. I don't know what she took, but her internal strength is extreme cold and yin. It is said that even if she is poisoned, she can use her internal strength to suppress it for a short time. In addition, she was personally trained by the owner of Fengyu Tower."</strong></p> <p><strong>"Her strength is terrifying, and her danger level is even higher than that of the Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin."</strong></p> <p><strong>"She never kills people by assassination. She always does it openly and kills the target cleanly and neatly."</strong></p> <p><strong>&#8220;Anyone who tries to stop her will be taken care of. That&#8217;s why people in the martial arts world call her Yu Luosha. She has a lot of blood on her hands.&#8221;</strong></p> <p>(<em>Yu Luosha: Jade Rakshasa</em></p> <p></p> <p>The little blind boy wanted to cry but had no tears. He muttered, <strong>&#8220;What bad luck, what bad luck... How come I meet her when I just stay at an inn?&#8221;</strong></p> <p>Seeing his look, Chen Ye couldn&#8217;t help laughing. <strong>"By the way, what do you think? Is she a beauty as you said?"</strong></p> <p>The little blind boy&#8217;s face changed drastically. His expression became nervous as he put his finger to his lips and whispered, <strong>"Shh! There is only a wall between us and her; she can hear every word we say!"</strong></p> <p><strong>"So powerful?"</strong> Chen Ye said with a smile.</p> <p>The little blind boy wanted to cry but had no tears. <strong>"Please! Mr. Hua, the assassins in Fengyu Tower have eyes and ears far better than ordinary warriors. There's just a wall between us. Our conversation has probably fallen into her ears by now."</strong></p> <p>After saying that, the little blind boy asked in confusion, <strong>"Mr. Hua, why did you wade into this muddy water?"</strong></p> <p><strong>"If Wanjin Hall knew that you sold them out, they would probably hunt you down."</strong></p> <p>Chen Ye smiled helplessly. <strong>"It's a long story, but it's all for the children."</strong></p> <p>The little blind boy was stunned for a moment. Thinking about Chen Ye's words and his previous question, his face became strange.</p> <p><strong>"Mr. Hua, she is not an ordinary person who can..."</strong></p> <p>The little blind boy stopped halfway and said no more. He was afraid that there were ears on the other side of the wall. If that person stabbed him with the sword, it would be miserable.</p> <p>The little blind boy was silent for a moment before sighing. <strong>"I admire you!"</strong></p> <p>Qin Yi sat at the wooden table.</p> <p>The Yangchun noodles in front of her had already lumped together. The snow-white noodles had absorbed the noodle soup and become swollen and loose.</p> <p>As she exhaled, she heard the conversation between Chen Ye and the little blind boy next door.</p> <p>A complex thought flashed in Qin Yi's autumn-like eyes.</p> <p><strong>"Earthly branches have changed."</strong></p> <p>Those four words verified everything she had been investigating for a month.</p> <p>A month ago, she assassinated Tang Feng. From the information she learned from Tang Hao, she speculated on a possibility.</p> <p>Someone in the underworld was planning to lure out the assassins of Fengyu Tower and then kill them. This was to weaken Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>However, Qin Yi had been investigating for a month and only found out that there was a problem with the intelligence contact person in the Yuhang County Liquor Store.</p> <p>She did not find out who he reported to.</p> <p>Fengyu Tower's intelligence system has always been a single-line connection. The assassins and the intelligence personnel belong to two different departments.</p> <p>Even though she was taught by the owner of the Tower, she didn&#8217;t know anything about the intelligence system.</p> <p>The clues ended here.</p> <p>The other anomaly was that many assassins in Fengyu Tower had failed their missions in the past month.</p> <p>These anomalies, combined, faintly revealed that there was a problem within the intelligence agency of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p><strong>"Earthly branches have changed."</strong></p> <p>Qin Yi's eyes gradually turned cold.</p> <p>The intelligence of Fengyu Tower was handled by twelve mysterious "earthly branches." No one had ever seen their true faces, nor did they know where they were.</p> <p>It was only known that the earthly branches would pass the collected intelligence to the lower levels one at a time for the assassins to review.</p> <p>Now, Zhao Wu, the Silver Spear, who was also a gold medal assassin, was dead.</p> <p>Before his death, he passed on the four words, <em>"Earthly branches have changed."</em></p> <p>That was enough to explain the problem.</p> <p>There was a <strong>traitor</strong> among the twelve earthly branches.</p> <p><strong>Someone had betrayed Fengyu Tower.</strong></p> <p>Qin Yi's gaze landed on the bowl of lumped Yangchun noodles.</p> <p>Then, a flash of inspiration struck her.</p> <p><strong>"No... it's not the earthly branches that have changed!"</strong></p> <p><strong>"There is a traitor among the deacons!"</strong></p> <p>Qin Yi's eyes gradually brightened.</p> <p>She put down her sword, took off her veil, and picked up her chopsticks again.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The next day.</p> <p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy got up early, had breakfast, and went to Tieque Villa in the suburbs of Jiangning County like most warriors in the city.</p> <p>"Those with waves and clouds on the chest, that's the people of the Haijing Gang. The gang leader Qiong Longshan is a first-class master, and his pair of Jingtao Palms are invincible along the coast!"</p> <p>"Let's not mess with them."&#160;</p> <p>"A red robe with copper coins embroidered on the chest? That's Master Huoyun of Wanjin Hall, an early second-class master, and his father is the Fire Dragon King, one of the twelve hall masters.</p> <p>"Let's stay away from them."</p> <p>The little blind boy listened to Chen Ye's description and kept talking about the identities of the people around him.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the five people not far away and said, "Holding iron fans, flying claws, and crescent-shaped shovels, wearing yellow-brown brocade clothes, and with mountain embroidery on the back, which sect are they from?"</p> <p>"Look, are there five people?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>The little blind boy lowered his voice and said, "Those are the Five Sons of Kongtong, masters of the younger generation of Kongtong Sect. Their martial arts are mysterious and complicated. Their weapon techniques and fist and palm techniques are interconnected. A single weapon can be used like several different weapons. They are very powerful and are all in the late third rank.&#8221;</p> <p>"Although these five are not strong individually, they like to fight in groups. It's better to be careful. Let's avoid them."</p> <p>Along the way, through the little blind boy, Chen Ye got to know many sects and organizations.</p> <p>The journey was not long. Near noon, Chen Ye and the little blind boy arrived at Tieque Villa.</p> <p>Tieque Villa is very large. It covers an area of &#8203;&#8203;more than 100 acres. The courtyard walls are paved with turquoise tiles, which reflect emerald light under the sunlight. The ground is paved with stone slabs that look like they were carved from white jade, and various trees are planted in the garden.</p> <p>In front of the gate of Tieque Villa, an old man in an indigo gown, with gray hair and vigorous spirit stood in front of the gate. Many martial artists stood around him. These warriors, holding weapons in their hands, stood in groups of three or four near the manor, their eyes cold and alert.</p> <p>When Chen Ye and the little blind boy came to the gate, there was still half an hour before the official start of the selection of disciples.</p> <p>At noon, people could enter the garden.</p> <p>Chen Ye and the little blind boy stood not far from the gate, identifying the warriors by names. Master Huoyun of Wanjin Hall, the Five Sons of Kongtong, the Young Master of the Haijing Gang, the five generations of disciples of Kunlun Sect, the disciples of the Beggar Gang... among them were also scattered people from all over the world.</p> <p>"Brother Tian, why don't I see anyone from the Five Peaks Sword Sect and the Three Daoist Sects?"</p> <p>Chen Ye looked around and didn't see any disciples from the big sects.</p> <p>The little blind boy scratched his ear with his nails, grinning as he said, "Even if the Five Peaks Sword Sect doesn&#8217;t have anything important going on, they won&#8217;t come down the mountain."</p> <p>"Besides, Qing Xuzi beat up all the sect leaders of the Five Peaks Sword Sect back in the day. If their disciples came down to join the selection, their sect leaders and elders would probably beat them to death."</p> <p>"As for the three Daoist sects, they definitely won&#8217;t come."</p> <p>"Qing Xuzi has already chosen his successor."</p> <p>Chen Ye's heart stirred, and he asked curiously, "Chosen a successor?"</p> <p>"Since the successor has been chosen, why go through all this trouble with such a grand selection?"</p> <p>The little blind boy suddenly fell silent and laughed, "I don&#8217;t know about that."</p> <p>"Anyway, it has nothing to do with me. I&#8217;m just here to find someone."</p> <p>"Find someone? What do they look like? If I see them, I&#8217;ll tell you."</p> <p>Chen Ye knew the little blind boy knew quite a lot, but when it came to certain matters, the boy was tight-lipped and nothing could be pried out of him.</p> <p>"I don&#8217;t know what they look like, but the person I&#8217;m looking for is the same one Zhang Zhiling is looking for." The little blind boy flicked the earwax he had scraped out with his nails and said.</p> <p>Chen Ye understood.</p> <p>"Are you looking for the successor selected by Zhang Zhiling?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>As the two of them talked, time passed by.</p> <p>The housekeeper of Tieque Villa looked at the sun and knew that the time had come.</p> <p>He coughed lightly, and the low voice was like thunder.</p> <p>The warriors who were originally a little noisy all heard their ears ring at the same time, and they couldn't help but look at the housekeeper.</p> <p>The little blind boy grinned, covered his ears and said, "This man has deep internal strength, at least a second-grade master."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the old man, who had an indifferent expression. Although his hair was gray, he looked like he was only in his sixties.</p> <p>"Everyone!"</p> <p>"I guess you are all here to participate in my master's selection of disciples!"</p> <p>"Let&#8217;s not say too much nonsense."</p> <p>"The first rule set by my master is: Those above the second-grade realm are qualified to inherit his mansion!"</p> <p>The old man's voice was loud, and when he spoke, it was as if thunder rumbled in everyone's ears.</p> <p>After the housekeeper finished speaking, all the warriors present changed their faces.</p> <p>"Above the second-grade realm? What a joke!"&#160;</p> <p>"There are only a few second-grade realms in each sect!"&#160;</p> <p>"You are kidding me!" &#160; &#160;</p> <p>"Damn it, I rushed eight hundred miles, for three days, and you tell me that I am not qualified?" &#160; &#160;&#160;</p> <p>The warriors around were discussing angrily. Most of these people were in the third or fourth-grade realm. &#160; &#160;&#160;</p> <p>In the entire martial arts world, the second-grade realm is considered the backbone and inheritor of the sect. &#160; &#160;&#160;</p> <p>After hearing this request, Chen Ye was also a little surprised.</p> <p>"Isn't Qing Xuzi's request too grand?"&#160;</p> <p>After chatting with the little blind boy, Chen Ye knew a lot about the martial arts world.&#160;</p> <p>"As long as it is above the second grade, are you trying to poach the inheritors of other sects?" &#160;</p> <p>The little blind boy smiled and said, "It's intentional. I said it was already decided." &#160; &#160;&#160;</p> <p>The old housekeeper standing in front of the villa suddenly changed his face. &#160;&#160;</p> <p>Some of the warriors around were cursing Qing Xuzi's ancestors.</p> <p>"Swoosh!" Several sounds of breaking through the air were heard.</p> <p>"Ah!"</p> <p>"Ah!"</p> <p>And it was accompanied by several screams.</p> <p>Five or six warriors around had a golden dart on their throats. They covered their throats with disbelief.</p> <p>"Hehe..."</p> <p>The warriors made a few vague sounds and fell to the ground.</p> <p>The ground suddenly had a few more bloody streaks.</p> <p>This sudden move startled all the warriors present.</p> <p>The old housekeeper snorted coldly, and the sound was like thunder, deafening.</p> <p>"Whoever insults the master again will see the end at that instant, although I am old, I still have some strength in my hands and feet." As soon as these words came out, all the warriors around shut their mouths.</p> <p>"It's him! Golden Thunder Dart - Hong Jinlei!"</p> <p>Someone exclaimed in a low voice, recognizing the identity of the old housekeeper.</p> <p>Everyone was startled, and looked at the old housekeeper with a little more fear.</p> <p>Chen Ye whispered in the little blind boy's ear: "Who is he?"</p> <p>"Hong Jinlei, a hidden weapon master who has been in the martial arts world for 20 years, second-grade realm, deep internal strength, because his voice is like thunder and he is good at using gold darts, so he is nicknamed Golden Thunder Dart."</p> <p>"He used to be the third in command of the Taihang Mountain bandits. He met Zhang Zhiling during a robbery and then disappeared."</p> <p>"Everyone thought he was dead, but he was actually Zhang Zhiling's housekeeper."</p> <p>The surrounding warriors all shut up when they learned that the old housekeeper in front of them was Jin Leibiao who had been in the Taihang Mountain 20 years ago.</p> <p>A second-grade master is far from being something that these low-level warriors can provoke.</p> <p>"It turns out to be Senior Hong. My master once had a friendship with Senior Hong in Taihang Mountain."</p> <p>The fifth-generation disciple of Kunlun School stepped forward, performed the junior's salute, and said with a bow.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei glanced at the man, recognized the Kunlun School's clothes, and nodded with a much more relaxed expression.</p> <p>Seeing Hong Jinlei's expression of ease, the Kunlun School disciple smiled: "Disciple Liu Kaiyun, the Red Sand Palm has been perfected."</p> <p>Hong Jinlei exhaled and spoke, his voice like thunder: "Come up and try it!"</p> <p>Liu Kaiyun heard the words, displayed his body skills, his feet were light, and his figure flashed in front of Hong Jinlei.</p> <p>He clasped his fists and bowed, saying: "Senior Hong, please!"</p> <p>Hong Jinlei nodded.</p> <p>Liu Kaiyun retracted his fists, moved his body skills, and approached Hong Jinlei within three feet.</p> <p>He changed his fists into palms, and a dark red luster flashed on his palms. That was the power of the Red Sand Palm.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei glanced at Liu Kaiyun lightly, and struck out with his right palm without any fancy elements.</p> <p>The two palms collided.</p> <p>"Bang!" There was a loud sound.</p> <p>Liu Kaiyun was knocked back several steps by Hong Jinlei, and his face changed from yellow to red, and then from red to yellow, and returned to normal.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei said calmly: "Yes, you have achieved the Great Mastery of Red Sand Palm, you are qualified."</p> <p>"Stand behind me."</p> <p>Kunlun Sect's Liu Kaiyun showed a happy expression and walked behind Hong Jinlei.</p> <p>Seeing that one person passed easily, the surrounding warriors all became agitated.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The little blind boy couldn't see, so he hurriedly asked Chen Ye: "What happened?"</p> <p>"The Kunlun Sect's Liu Kaiyun fought with Hong Jinlei and passed." Chen Ye said.</p> <p>The little blind boy pondered for a moment and continued to ask: "What was Liu Kaiyun's face like after being hit by the palm?"</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the little blind boy in surprise and added: "He turned red, then yellow, and returned to normal."</p> <p>"It seems that his internal strength has not been cultivated yet, but his Red Sand Palm has been fully cultivated. It is estimated to be the early stage of the second grade."</p> <p>The little blind boy gave his own opinion.</p> <p>Chen Ye humbly asked: "How are the strengths and weaknesses in the second grade divided?"</p> <p>He only knew that if a corresponding grade of skills or secrets were cultivated to perfection, it would be considered to have reached the realm of the corresponding grade.</p> <p>But Chen Ye was not clear about the specific division.</p> <p>The little blind boy knew that Chen Ye knew very little about the common things of the martial arts world, so he patiently explained, "Take the second grade as an example. No matter whether it is internal power, weapon skills, or body skills, as long as you practice the second-grade secret book and practice the secret book to the great success realm, broadly speaking, you are considered a second-grade martial artist."</p> <p>"But think about it, a person who has practiced internal power, sword skills, and body skills to the great success realm, against a person who has only practiced palm skills to the great success realm, the strength will naturally be different."</p> <p>"So when it comes to the second grade, the number of second-grade secret books that have been practiced to the great success realm is the measurement standard."</p> <p>"Mastering one great success is the early stage; two great successes are the middle stage; three great successes are the late stage; four or more are the peak."</p> <p>At this point, the little blind boy paused, scratched his head and said, "But there are special cases. Strength varies from person to person."</p> <p>"It is best to practice martial arts based on internal strength, and moves are all external."</p> <p>"For example, Qing Xuzi, his Innate Qi Skill, after practicing it, every move is the power of a first-grade great success secret book."</p> <p>"But internal skills require long-term practice, and cannot be effective quickly."</p> <p>"Unlike weapon skills, fist skills, and palm skills, as long as you have good talent, you will always see results after practicing for a few years."&#160;</p> <p>After the little blind boy finished speaking, Chen Ye completely understood the strength classification.</p> <p>"In general, only those above the third rank are considered to have officially entered the path of a warrior, and there is not much difference in strength between the fourth rank and the inferior."</p> <p>As the little blind boy explained, there was a challenger in front of the Tieque Villa. Master Huoyun, dressed in red and with two white jade pearls in his right hand, walked in front of Hong Jinlei and bowed.</p> <p>"Senior Hong, please teach me."</p> <p>Hong Jinlei did not speak.</p> <p>Master Huoyun jumped up, his red clothes like fire, and he rushed towards Hong Jinlei at a high speed like a meteor.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei opened his eyes wide, took a deep breath, and the internal force in his body flowed into his arms.</p> <p>"Bang Bang!"</p> <p>Both of them used palm skills, and they fought several times in a few breaths.</p> <p>Master Huoyun's body movements were agile, like a jumping flame.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei's moves were wide and wild, his face expressionless, and every time he swung his palms, there was a sound of breaking wind.</p> <p>The surrounding warriors of lower realms were terrified.</p> <p>If this palm hit them, they would probably die on the spot.</p> <p>With a "pop" sound, Master Huoyun flipped backwards and landed steadily on the ground.</p> <p>He had a handsome face and elegant appearance. He bowed to Hong Jinlei and said, "Senior Hong, thank you."</p> <p>Hong Jinlei didn't say much, just nodded, waved his left hand and motioned him to come over.</p> <p>Master Huoyun walked behind Hong Jinlei with a faint smile, holding a white jade pearl in his hand.</p> <p>The fight between the two was more beautiful than Kunlun Sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun.</p> <p>The young female knights present couldn't help but look at Master Huoyun a few more times, with waves in their eyes.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Master Huoyun a few times. The other party was indeed good-looking, but there was still some distance between him and himself.</p> <p>If Chen Ye took off his mask, it would probably attract the attention of a large number of female warriors.</p> <p>At this time, a burly young man in a navy blue shirt walked through the crowd.</p> <p>He had a serious expression and clasped his fists and said, "Haijing Gang, I am Qiong Aohai. Please teach me as well!"</p> <p>The young man looked young, only about eighteen or nineteen years old.</p> <p>He didn't say much, and after he finished speaking, he started to use his body skills and attacked Hong Jinlei with both palms.</p> <p>Chen Ye locked his eyes on the young man.</p> <p>He was the young leader of the Haijing Gang, a genius with second-grade strength at the age of eighteen or nineteen. He was deeply loved by the leader of the Haijing Gang.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai waved his palms, and his palms were magnificent and domineering. Every move was like a surging wave hitting the sky.</p> <p>Just watching from the side, it seemed that one could feel the pressure of the waves that rolled up dozens of feet high and suddenly slapped down.</p> <p>"It's the Jingtao Palm of the Haijing Gang!"</p> <p>"So strong!"</p> <p>The surrounding warriors exclaimed in surprise, with envy and jealousy in their eyes.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai's palms were impenetrable, and they attacked Hong Jinlei one after another, like real waves, continuous and endless.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei felt the palm power like a tsunami, and a trace of caution appeared on his face.</p> <p>The two men's fists and palms collided quickly, making a sound of fists hitting flesh.</p> <p>After a few moves, Hong Jinlei was suddenly hit in the chest by Qiong Aohai. He stepped back a few steps to dissolve the palm power, and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai retracted his palms and stood in place, still with a serious expression on his face. He clasped his fists and said, "Thank you."</p> <p>After that, Qiong Aohai walked behind Hong Jinlei and stood with Master Huoyun and the Kunlun sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun.</p> <p>Master Huoyun complimented Qiong Aohai, "Brother Aohai has great palm power!"</p> <p>Qiong Aohai didn't even look at him, and looked at the other warriors.</p> <p>Master Huoyun was embarrassed because he was asking for trouble.</p> <p>He didn't say anything more. There was no point in talking.</p> <p>Seeing that Qiong Aohai could actually repel Hong Jinlei, the surrounding warriors were all shocked.</p> <p>"He actually repelled Senior Hong with one palm. Young Master Qiong is so terrifying!"</p> <p>"When Young Master Qiong was born, the Shenji Sect had predicted that he would be a natural warrior!"</p> <p>"I wonder if Young Master Qiong is married..."</p> <p>"..."</p> <p>The people around were talking about it.</p> <p>Chen Ye was also a little surprised and said, "This Qiong Aohai is so powerful that he could actually repel Hong Jinlei."</p> <p>The little blind boy on the side said indifferently, "Hong Jinlei's specialty is hidden weapons, not palm techniques."</p> <p>"However, Qiong Aohai could repel Hong Jinlei, so his Jingtao Palm must have been fully developed. He is only eighteen or nineteen years old, but he could practice Jingtao Palm to perfection. This talent is not low."</p> <p>"If he can also have some talent in internal skills, he can probably be promoted to the first-grade realm before he is thirty years old."</p> <p>The little blind boy said with some emotion, "He is much more talented than his father."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Qiong Aohai.</p> <p>The other person was burly, with strong arms and a masculine face.</p> <p>However, a hint of childishness could still be seen on his face.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei looked at the warriors around him and said in a deafening voice, "Who else?"</p> <p>The five Kongtong disciples next to him looked at each other, gritted their teeth, and were unwilling to give up.</p> <p>The five of them were all in the late third-grade realm, not the second-grade realm required by Qingxuzi.</p> <p>"Senior, can you relax the standards?" One of the five Kongtong disciples shouted.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei glanced at him coldly, too lazy to pay attention to him.</p> <p>Seeing that the other party looked down on them so much, the five Kongtong disciples all looked unhappy.</p> <p>They looked at each other and said in unison, "Let us learn from the senior's high skills!"</p> <p>After that, the five of them jumped up and went on stage together.</p> <p>They held five kinds of strange weapons in their hands: Iron Fan, Flying Claws, Judge's Pen, Money Throwing Daggers, and A Crescent-shaped Shovel.</p> <p>"Swoosh, swoosh..."</p> <p>Several sounds of breaking through the air rang out.</p> <p>As soon as the five of them landed, their knees were hit at the same time.</p> <p>"Ouch!"</p> <p>"Hiss..."</p> <p>The five people cried out a few times and knelt on the ground at the same time.</p> <p>Each of them had a gold coin dart stuck in his knee, and their clothes were stained red by the blood.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei didn't even look at the five people, and said loudly: "Is there anyone else?"</p> <p>Seeing that the Kongtong Five were hit in the knee by the gold coin dart as soon as they came on the stage, the surrounding warriors couldn't help but shudder.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei is indeed a veteran second-grade warrior with strong strength.</p> <p>If an ordinary second-grade early-stage warrior faced five third-grade late-stage warriors at the same time, he would have no choice but to run away.</p> <p>But Hong Jinlei solved the five people in an instant, and his strength was really extraordinary.</p> <p>Perhaps Hong Jinlei also wanted to use these five people to save face.</p> <p>After all, being knocked back a few steps by a junior with a palm, it would not sound good to say it out.</p> <p>"I'll do it!"</p> <p>"I'll try it too!"</p> <p>Two voices rang out at the same time.</p> <p>Everyone looked over and saw a young man with a long sword on his waist, walking through the crowd with dragon and tiger-like steps.</p> <p>The other man was a young man in a green shirt, plain clothes and pale face.</p> <p>The warriors around recognized them.</p> <p>"It's him! The Guandong Swordsman - Xie Fei!"</p> <p>"The Wuxiang Acupuncturist - Shan Wei!"</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the two men. They were both independent men, and their masters were unknown.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Hong Jinlei raised his left shoulder, revealing a flaw under his ribs.</p> <p>Shan Wei was delighted when he saw this, and used the Wuxiang Finger Technique to press the acupuncture points under Hong Jinlei's ribs.</p> <p>As soon as his fingers touched Hong Jinlei's ribs, a strong internal force pushed his fingers away.</p> <p>Shan Wei had never encountered such a situation before. He was in doubt.</p> <p>"Pah!"</p> <p>Hong Jinlei struck Shan Wei's shoulder with a palm, causing him to fall to the ground.</p> <p>He was pale and his expression was ugly.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei glanced at him and said, "In acupuncture, internal force is crucial."</p> <p>"Your body skills are quite good, but your internal force is too poor."</p> <p>Hearing Hong Jinlei's comments, Shan Wei took a deep breath, stood up from the ground, and bowed respectfully.</p> <p>He understood that Hong Jinlei had just deliberately exposed a flaw to lure him in.</p> <p>Although it was a bit embarrassing to be slapped to the ground by Hong Jinlei, Hong Jinlei's comments did make sense.</p> <p>Although acupuncture is extremely powerful, it will become useless if it cannot break through the opponent's protective qi.</p> <p>After Shan Wei saluted, he turned around and walked through the crowd without hesitation and left.</p> <p>"Who else?!" Hong Jinlei shouted loudly.</p> <p>There were four people standing behind him.</p> <p>Kunlun Sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun, Huoyun Gongzi, Qiong Aohai, and Xie Fei, the Guandong swordsman who had just passed.</p> <p>There were hundreds of warriors gathered in Jiangning Mansion, but there were only a few with second-grade strength.</p> <p>The disciples of the famous sects were restricted by the sect and could not come.</p> <p>The rest who could come had basically arrived.</p> <p>The little blind man tilted his head and glanced at Chen Ye and whispered, "Mr. Hua, aren't you going?"</p> <p>Chen Ye blinked and said, "I am good at Qinggong, not fists, feet and palm skills. How can I fight him?"</p> <p>The little blind man smiled when he heard it: "This is simple, just make sure he can't hit you. Or, you can run behind him when he is not paying attention, that's fine."</p> <p>Chen Ye thought about it, and a little excitement rose in his heart.</p> <p>Who wouldn't want the innate internal power that can fight eight people alone after practicing?</p> <p>This is probably the top internal power method in the world!</p> <p>Chen Ye took a deep breath and was about to shout: I'll do it.</p> <p>A figure suddenly rushed into the field.</p> <p>The man was short, not much taller than a ten-year-old child, with a turban wrapped around his head. He looked mature and had a beard.</p> <p>He said in a hoarse voice: "Old man Hong, let me try too."</p> <p>When Hong Jinlei saw the man, his expression changed and he sneered: "Shanxi Dwarf Tiger - Peng Tong, you are a first-class master, and you have the nerve to come here?"</p> <p>Peng Tong laughed twice: "Qing Xuzi does not look at origin or background when selecting disciples."</p> <p>"Why can't I come? My strength is above the second rank, and it does not violate the rules set by Qing Xuzi."</p> <p>"Why, old man Hong, are you going to stop me?"</p> <p>Hong Jinlei sneered twice and said nothing.</p> <p>Peng Tong, who was less than 1.3 meters tall, walked behind Hong Jinlei with a swagger.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei ignored him and turned to look at others: "Anyone else?"</p> <p>The warriors looked at each other, and no one dared to answer.</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly said, "Senior Hong, I want to give it a try too!"</p> <p>As soon as he said this, the surrounding warriors looked at Chen Ye.</p> <p>&#8216;It's him.&#8217; A woman in a green washed dress saw the silver mask on Chen Ye's face and thought to herself.</p> <p>She was the woman who rode the donkey cart with Chen Ye yesterday.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei looked at Chen Ye and said nothing.</p> <p>Chen Ye touched the mask on his face and smiled, "Senior Hong, I am good at body movements, and I can't fight with Senior Hong."</p> <p>"If I can get behind you, Senior Hong, would that be enough for me to pass?"</p> <p>Hearing Chen Ye say this, the surrounding warriors all talked about it.</p> <p>"Yes! Why didn't I think of it? Although I am not good at attacking, I can escape!"</p> <p>A third-grade warrior who specializes in Qinggong said with great sorrow, as if he had missed a great opportunity.</p> <p>Someone sneered and said, "It's not that easy. Although Hong Jinlei is good at hidden weapons, his body skills are not weak either!"</p> <p>"If it is an ordinary second-grade master who practices Qinggong, he probably can't get through Hong Jinlei's hands."</p> <p>"Not necessarily. If you just run behind Hong Jinlei, there is still a chance!"</p> <p>The surrounding warriors discussed enthusiastically, exploring the feasibility of what Chen Ye said.</p> <p>Listening to the discussions of the people around him, Hong Jinlei frowned and thought for a moment, then said in a deep voice: "Yes!"</p> <p>"Thank you, Senior Hong."</p> <p>Chen Ye said respectfully.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei's body froze and he was stunned on the spot.</p> <p>He turned around slowly and saw the silver mask appear behind him, standing with Master Huoyun and others.</p> <p>Hearing the voice, Master Huoyun, Liu Kaiyun, Qiong Aohai and others were all shocked.</p> <p>They looked at Chen Ye, widened their eyes, and were horrified.</p> <p>When did this person come here?</p> <p>The surrounding warriors, seeing that Chen Ye had appeared behind Hong Jinlei, all opened their mouths wide, with a look of shock on their faces.</p> <p>After a short silence, the warriors all screamed.</p> <p>"Oh my god! When did he get there?"</p> <p>"What kind of body movement is this? How come I didn't see anything?"</p> <p>"If he had attacked me by surprise, I would probably be dead now!"</p> <p>"Who is this guy? Why does he have no name in the martial arts world?"</p> <p>The warriors surrounding Tieque Villa all screamed in shock, looking extremely frightened.</p> <p>The woman who had ridden in a donkey cart with Chen Ye had round almond eyes and a rosy little mouth, exclaiming: "What a powerful Qinggong!"</p> <p>Standing not far from Chen Ye, Peng Tong, the Shanxi Dwarf Tiger, narrowed his eyes slightly, and was also shocked.</p> <p>Not to mention the second-rank masters such as Master Huoyun, even he, a first-rank master, didn't notice when Chen Ye came!</p> <p>Who is this person?</p> <p>Hong Jinlei looked at Chen Ye deeply, and looked at the crowd without revealing his expression.</p> <p>He nodded, turned around and looked at the other warriors again: "Who else?"</p> <p>It was obvious.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei recognized Chen Ye's Qinggong.</p> <p>In the crowd, the little blind man was stunned for a moment, and he tilted his head to "look" to the side.</p> <p>"Master Hua?"</p> <p>There was no familiar voice around him.</p> <p>The corners of the little blind man's mouth twitched twice, and he murmured softly: "No wonder Xu Xiaolin didn't make a move."</p> <p>He raised his head slightly, "looked" in the direction of Tieque Villa, and a smile appeared on his face.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at the little blind man not far away, and smiled faintly under the mask.</p> <p>"What's your name, brother?"</p> <p>A gentle voice came from beside him, giving people a neutral feeling.</p> <p>Chen Ye turned around and saw that Master Huoyun was holding two white jade pearls in his right hand and smiled at him.</p> <p>"Donghua." Chen Ye bowed slightly and smiled.</p> <p>The people behind Hong Jinlei silently recited the name Donghua in their hearts.</p> <p>There seemed to be no such person in the Jianghu.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai looked at Chen Ye, with a serious face, and said in a deep voice: "Your Qinggong is good."</p> <p>"How about palm skills?"</p> <p>Master Huoyun just talked to Qiong Aohai, but Qiong Aohai ignored him.</p> <p>Chen Ye performed a Qinggong, which attracted Qiong Aohai's attention.</p> <p>"I am not very good at boxing and kicking." Chen Ye told the truth.</p> <p>He can defend and run now, but he can't fight.</p> <p>However, if the system draws an offensive skill one day, Chen Ye will take off directly.</p> <p>Hearing Chen Ye say this, Qiong Aohai showed a hint of disappointment in his eyes.</p> <p>He nodded and said nothing more.</p> <p>The Guandong swordsman, Xie Fei and Kunlun Sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun did not talk to Chen Ye. They just glanced at Chen Ye and looked away.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>In front of Tieque Villa.</p> <p>After Hong Jinhai asked several more times, he saw that no one continued to challenge. He took a deep breath, summoned his internal strength, and said in a loud voice: "Everyone, the first round of selection is over!</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>After saying that, Hong Jinlei led the six people who passed the test and walked into Tieque Villa.</p> <p>After the remaining warriors looked at each other, some of them followed and walked into Tieque Villa.</p> <p>Even if they were not qualified, they wanted to see who would inherit Qing Xuzi's mantle in the end!</p> <p>That was a martial arts legend twenty years ago. The person he chose must be extraordinary.</p> <p>The little blind boy followed the crowd to Tieque Villa, holding a wooden stick in his hand, poking the ground while muttering softly: "You are really disloyal and left your brothers here."</p> <p>"Oh? Am I a disloyal person in Brother Tian's mind?"</p> <p>A familiar voice came from the side.</p> <p>The little blind boy was immediately delighted and smiled: "Master Hua, your Qinggong is so awesome!"</p> <p>Chen Ye's figure appeared next to the little blind boy.</p> <p>The surrounding warriors were all startled and looked at Chen Ye in shock.</p> <p>They looked behind Hong Jinlei and then at Chen Ye, their eyes full of shock.</p> <p>This man's Qinggong is so amazing!</p> <p>In an instant, he appeared more than ten feet away!</p> <p>"Let's go, aren't you looking for someone? If nothing unexpected happens, the person you're looking for is among the six of us."</p> <p>Chen Ye put one hand on the little blind boy's shoulder, took a step forward, and the skill &#8216;Ground Shrinking Step&#8217; was activated.</p> <p>Chen Ye let go of the little blind boy's shoulder.</p> <p>"Huh? What's wrong?" The little blind boy felt that Chen Ye had just put his hand on his shoulder and let it go in a second.</p> <p>"What's wrong?" Chen Ye said in confusion: "Let's go, you're already in."</p> <p>The little blind boy was stunned on the spot, his mouth wide open, unbelievable.</p> <p>"Master Hua's qinggong is probably not inferior to the Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin!" Master Huoyun on the side said with vigilance and envy in his eyes.</p> <p>This envy is envy of Chen Ye's superb qinggong, and vigilance is because Chen Ye will be a competitor in a while!</p> <p>The little blind boy heard Master Huoyun's voice close at hand, and then he realized that he really came in.</p> <p>And he was following behind Hong Jinlei!</p> <p>"My... my ancestor!"</p> <p>The little blind boy was stunned and stuttered when he spoke.</p> <p>What is the origin of this Master Hua whom he met on the road?!</p> <p>Yesterday, he was led by Chen Ye to avoid Xu Xiaolin's attack. Because he couldn't see, he didn't know that Chen Ye could cross thirty feet in an instant.</p> <p>Today, Chen Ye took him into Tieque Villa, which can really be described as "divine skills".</p> <p>"Master, Master, my luck is really amazing!"</p> <p>The little blind boy followed Chen Ye and sighed.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei led six people into Tieque Villa.</p> <p>The building placed in the courtyard attracted Chen Ye's attention. It was a two-meter-high iron sparrow.</p> <p>"I saw a two-meter-high iron sparrow, is there any explanation?"</p> <p>Chen Ye asked the little blind boy in a low voice.</p> <p>"This Iron Sparrow is the origin of the Tieque Villa, and it is related to another owner of the villa."&#160;</p> <p>The little blind boy lowered his voice, paused for a moment, as if he had some reservations, and said: "In short, this is a symbol of status. If you want to know, I will tell you later."</p> <p>Master Huoyun beside him couldn't help laughing and said: "This is not something that cannot be said."</p> <p>"Everyone in the martial arts world knows that Tieque married Qing Xuzi, and the two of them retired from the martial arts world together and no longer asked about the affairs of the martial arts world."</p> <p>"The Iron Sparrow is just placed in the Tieque Villa as a memory of the past."</p> <p>"Little brother, you are too cautious. Senior Hong will not take action against us just because we discussed the beginning and end of the Tieque Villa."</p> <p>Master Huoyun glanced at the little blind boy lightly. The little blind boy did not speak, but just snorted and murmured softly: "What do you know?"</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the two-meter-high Iron Sparrow statue. He didn't expect there was such a story behind it.</p> <p>He heard the storyteller say that Qing Xuzi and his friends founded the Tieque Villa and no longer asked about the affairs of the martial arts world.</p> <p>He didn't say that this "Tieque" married Qing Xuzi.</p> <p>Seeing that the little blind boy didn't speak and his face was stern, Chen Ye realized that he might know some inside information and didn't want to say it in front of others.</p> <p>Soon, Hong Jinlei led everyone to the reception hall of Tieque Villa.</p> <p>A large number of martial artists followed behind him and they followed in.</p> <p>"Master!"</p> <p>Hong Jinlei stood in front of the reception hall with the door closed and shouted loudly.</p> <p>"Guests from afar, please come in."</p> <p>A gentle middle-aged voice came from the reception hall.</p> <p>"Hua..."</p> <p>A gust of wind sounded, and the door of the reception hall was pushed open out of thin air by someone's internal force.</p> <p>Everyone also saw the scene in the reception hall.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>In the extremely wide hall.</p> <p>A middle-aged man in brocade clothes sat on the main seat.</p> <p>The man had an elegant face, a long black beard on his chin, slightly deep eyes, and a light temperament, like an immortal who was not stained by dust.</p> <p>From the facial features, it can be seen that the other party must have been very handsome when he was young.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei walked in, clasped his fists respectfully and said, "Master!"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling responded and looked at the six people who had passed the test behind him.</p> <p>He looked at everyone's faces calmly, and at the same time took in their reactions.</p> <p>Kunlun Sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun looked at Zhang Zhiling and subconsciously looked away, as if he was a little nervous facing him.</p> <p>Wanjin Hall&#8217;s Master Huoyun looked directly at Zhang Zhiling and smiled lightly.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai had a serious face, his eyes, sharp like a blade, seemed to pierce through the martial arts legend from twenty years ago.</p> <p>Xie Fei, the Guandong Swordsman, had a calm look in his eyes, as if even a landslide would not cause him any emotional fluctuations.</p> <p>The only first-class master, Peng Tong, the &#160;Shanxi Tiger Dwarf, gritted his teeth and met Zhang Zhiling's gaze, worried that it would cause Zhang Zhiling's dissatisfaction.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling just glanced at him and stopped paying attention.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Zhang Zhiling with a calm look and a hint of curiosity.</p> <p>After seeing this, Chen Ye was a little disappointed.</p> <p>This martial arts legend from twenty years ago, except for his unworldly temperament, looked no different from an ordinary middle-aged man.</p> <p>This made Chen Ye a little disappointed.</p> <p>Come to think of it, we are all human beings, with one head, two arms and two legs. No matter how famous the name is, we are still human beings after all.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling's eyes fell on Chen Ye, as if he noticed something, a flash of astonishment crossed his eyes, and then turned into a flash of excitement.</p> <p>No one noticed this.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling withdrew his gaze from the six people and looked outside the reception hall. He said in a gentle voice: "Friends outside, come in too."</p> <p>The warriors surrounding the reception hall looked at each other and bravely entered the reception hall.</p> <p>However, although the reception hall is large, it still cannot accommodate too many people.</p> <p>There were still many warriors standing outside.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling stretched out his hand and said, "Take a seat."</p> <p>Hong Jinlei gestured to the six people to sit on the seats prepared on both sides of the reception hall.</p> <p>The little blind boy stopped before Chen Ye entered the door, and now stood on both sides of the reception hall like other warriors.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling retracted his gaze and said lightly: "I know very well what the six of you are here for."</p> <p>"If you want to become my, that is, Zhang Zhiling&#8217;s successor, the conditions are very simple."</p> <p>"All six of you can do it."</p> <p>As soon as these words came out, everyone's breathing became rapid.</p> <p>Master Huoyun of Wanjin Hall said: "Senior Zhang, I wonder what the conditions are?"</p> <p>He asked the question of everyone present.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling's eyes paused on Master Huoyun for a moment, and slowly said: "You just need to dissolve your internal strength."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Jiangning County, riverside.</p> <p>A shabby boat was parked on the water, with white rust on the hull, and it looked like it had been there for some time.</p> <p>An old man was sitting on the boat, holding a fishing rod in his hand, half-closed his eyes, as if he was asleep.</p> <p>Suddenly, ripples appeared on the water, and the fishing line at the end of the fishing rod rose and fell, and there was a pulling feeling. The half-closed old man opened his eyes and exerted a little force with his skinny hands.&#160;</p> <p>He pulled out a fat river fish that had bit the hook and was caught. The river fish fell on the boat, fluttering its body, splashing a large amount of water.</p> <p>"Deacon Li." A plain female voice came from behind the old man.</p> <p>The old man did not speak. The fishing rod in his hand shook lightly, and the river fish that fell on the boat was carried by the fishing line and accurately hit the fishing basket behind him.&#160;</p> <p>After doing all this, the old man said lightly: "What's the matter?"</p> <p>"Zhao Wu is dead." The plain female voice said.</p> <p>"He must not have been as good as others. If he is dead, so be it." The old man's voice was calm and without ups and downs.</p> <p>He swung the fishing rod in his hand, threw the hook again, and sank it into the water.</p> <p>The water surface rippled in circles around the hook.</p> <p>"He was killed by Xu Xiaolin, the Smiling Cat of Wanjin Hall." The woman continued.</p> <p>The old man nodded: "That's because he was unlucky."</p> <p>"If he had met someone else, he might have survived," the woman said calmly: "Unfortunately, he met Xu Xiaolin."</p> <p>The old man stared at the river and said lightly: "Zhao Wu's Qinggong is very good."</p> <p>"But it's still a little worse than Xu Xiaolin." The woman continued.</p> <p>"So he is unlucky."</p> <p>The woman did not speak. She stared at the river and held the scabbard tightly with her left hand.</p> <p>After a long time, she said calmly: "He is indeed unlucky."</p> <p>Several sword lights flashed.</p> <p>The old man felt his hands and feet grow cold and lost consciousness at the same time.</p> <p>Qin Yi slowly put the long sword back into the sheath, staring at Deacon Li with indifference.</p> <p>She just used the sword to cut the tendons of Deacon Li's hands and feet.</p> <p>Deacon Li turned his somewhat stiff neck and looked at Qin Yi behind him.</p> <p>"You know everything?" he asked calmly.</p> <p>Qin Yi nodded: "I don't know much."</p> <p>"You leaked Zhao Wu's information, so Xu Xiaolin appeared in Jiangning County."</p> <p>Deacon Li nodded expressionlessly: "You really don't know much."</p> <p>"Why did you betray Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Qin Yi's eyes were like autumn water, staring at Deacon Li, and her usually calm tone had a little more ripples.</p> <p>Deacon Li looked up at Qin Yi and smiled.</p> <p>"Everyone is betraying Fengyu Tower, but you just don't know it."</p> <p>Hearing this, Qin Yi was shocked.</p> <p>"Do you know the leader of the Shenji Sect?"</p> <p>Deacon Li stared at the lake. He didn't seem to care about his limbs being cut, but asked Qin Yi calmly.</p> <p>"I know."</p> <p>Qin Yi didn't understand why Deacon Li suddenly mentioned the most mysterious sect in the world.</p> <p>"Three months ago, he felt something in his heart and told a fortune."</p> <p>Deacon Li said calmly.</p> <p>"So what?" Qin Yi asked.</p> <p>Deacon Li smiled: "The master of Shenji Sect hasn't told any prophecies for twenty years. After he told the prophecy that day, he vomited blood. It had almost killed him."</p> <p>A flash of thought came to Qin Yi's mind.</p> <p>"Is it related to Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>She asked with a hint of urgency in her voice.</p> <p>Deacon Li did not answer her question, but said lightly: "The prophecy goes as such,"</p> <p>"In twenty years, there will be a great disaster in the martial arts world."</p> <p>"The source is an assassin organization with three words."</p> <p>At this point, Deacon Li's voice added a hint of sadness and sarcasm.</p> <p>Hearing this, Qin Yi was silent.</p> <p>She understood.</p> <p>"Shenji Sect is iron-mouthed and has made every possible plan. The master of Shenji Sect hasn't told fortunes for twenty years. Suddenly, he got a prophecy on a whim, but he wanted to destroy Fengyu Tower." Deacon Li sneered at the corner of his mouth, staring at the river with disdain.</p> <p>Qin Yi said calmly, "This is not a reason to betray."</p> <p>Deacon Li suddenly turned around and glanced at Qin Yi, his eyes deep, "You know too little."</p> <p>"Don't investigate anymore. Everyone is betraying Fengyu Tower. If you continue to investigate, you will die."</p> <p>Deacon Li looked at Qin Yi with a trace of compassion, as if in his eyes, even if his tendons were cut, Qin Yi was still the pitiful one.</p> <p>Qin Yi nodded: "Anything else to say?"</p> <p>"The fish was just caught, don't waste it."</p> <p>Deacon Li retracted his gaze and continued to stare at the river. The fishing line hanging from the fishing rod swayed lightly in the wind.</p> <p>The water surface was blown by the wind, and the waves were slow.</p> <p>Deacon Li looked at the fishing rod and the river calmly.</p> <p>It seemed that in the last moment of his life, he was still nostalgic for whether he could catch a fish.</p> <p>A sword flashed.</p> <p>Qin Yi left.</p> <p>After a long time.</p> <p>The fishing line hanging on the river was pulled by the fish into the water. The fishing rod that was originally tightly held in his hand swayed a few times and fell into the river. In a blink of an eye, it was washed away by the current and disappeared.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Tieque Villa, reception hall.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling's eyes paused on Master Huoyun for a moment, and he slowly said, "You just need to dissolve your internal strength."</p> <p>As soon as the voice fell, everyone present was stunned.</p> <p>The reception hall was dead silent.</p> <p>If a needle fell at this time, it would be heard clearly.</p> <p>"Senior Zhang, you said that the last test is to make us dissolve our internal strength?"</p> <p>Master Huoyun kept a smile on his face, but his tone was cold.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling nodded and said gently, "Yes."</p> <p>"The Innate Qi Skill cannot coexist with other internal forces. If you want to inherit my mantle, you must dissolve your internal strength." Zhang Zhiling explained.</p> <p>Everyone present understood what he meant. The six candidates were all silent and didn't say anything.</p> <p>Internal strength training is not a matter of one day or one night.</p> <p>The internal strength of Master Huoyun and others was practiced since childhood, and it took more than ten years to practice to this point.</p> <p>Shanxi Tiger Dwarf, Peng Tong has practiced internal strength for decades.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling asked them to abandon their life-long internal strength with just one sentence, which was equivalent to asking a man to castrate himself.</p> <p>For a moment, several people could not accept it.</p> <p>Shanxi Tiger Dwarf had a gloomy expression. To abandon the internal strength was equivalent to practicing internal skills from scratch.</p> <p>If one was less talented in internal skills, it would take decades of hard training to start over.</p> <p>More importantly, Peng Tong had many enemies in the martial arts world.</p> <p>If they knew that he had dispersed his internal strength and was re-cultivating his skills, they would definitely come for him.</p> <p>By then, he would be waiting for death.</p> <p>Thinking of this, Peng Tong's eyes flashed with a few fierce colors. He rolled his eyes a few times, clasped his fists and said, "Qing Xuzi, I quit."</p> <p>After saying that, Peng Tong stood up, left his seat, and stood on the side, with the other warriors.</p> <p>Although he quit, he still wanted to see who would become Qing Xuzi's successor in the end.</p> <p>"I quit too." Qiong Aohai, the young master of the Haijing Gang, did not hesitate at all. After he stood up, he left the reception hall directly without stopping.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai acted decisively.</p> <p>The only ones left on the field were Master Huoyun, Kunlun Sect&#8217;s Liu Kaiyun, Guandong swordsman, Xie Fei and Chen Ye.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The person who was most entangled at this time was Liu Kaiyun.</p> <p>His inner strength and mental method had not yet been cultivated to perfection, and it was classified as the third grade in terms of realm. He could completely abandon his inner strength and start over.</p> <p>However, Liu Kaiyun knew in his heart that he had a poor talent for inner strength.</p> <p>It would probably take more than ten years to practice his inner strength again.</p> <p>What's more, the inner strength of Daoism was more profound and complex than that of other sects, and it was difficult to practice.</p> <p>After thinking it over again and again, Liu Kaiyun gritted his teeth and said, "I quit."</p> <p>If he abolished his inner strength, he would lose everything he had. He would have to start over from a martial artist of the second-rate realm.</p> <p>Liu Kaiyun could not accept the gap from a second-rate master to a second-rate martial artist.</p> <p>Another person withdrew, leaving three people.</p> <p>Master Huoyun thought for a moment, smiled and shook his head, and bowed to Zhang Zhiling and said, "Senior Zhang, I will also quit."</p> <p>The inner strength he practiced was originally a first-rate mental method, and it was very powerful after being practiced.</p> <p>Now, after spending more than ten years, he finally reached the second level. It was impossible to give up.</p> <p>Master Huoyun knew himself well. He would at most enter the first level in the future.</p> <p>He had no chance to reach the Grandmaster level.</p> <p>Although Innate Qi Skill was powerful, it was necessary to abandon one's internal strength to practice it, which was too overbearing.</p> <p>Most of the internal strength mental methods circulating in the martial arts world were inclusive. As long as the internal strength attributes did not conflict, the internal strength could be replaced by changing the mental methods.</p> <p>Innate Qi Skill was not inclusive and too overbearing. Master Huoyun was unwilling to give up the internal strength he had cultivated.</p> <p>Another person withdrew, leaving only the Guandong swordsman, Xie Fei and Chen Ye on the field.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Xie Fei raised his left palm on the spot and slapped his dantian.</p> <p>His body shook, his face instantly turned as pale as paper, and a stream of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>Xie Fei calmly wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and remained silent.</p> <p>It's dissolved!</p> <p>It's really dissolved!</p> <p>The surrounding warriors widened their eyes and were very shocked.</p> <p>Xie Fei is well-known in the Guandong region for his powerful and fierce Five Tiger Swordsmanship.</p> <p>They didn't expect that he would actually destroy his own internal strength. "This is crazy. He can just destroy his internal strength after practicing so hard?"</p> <p>"He has the strength of a second-grade master! He just threw it away?"</p> <p>"There is no doubt that Xie Fei will become the successor of Zhang Zhiling!"</p> <p>The surrounding warriors were talking about it. Some of them looked at Xie Fei with jealousy, some gloating, and some with cold eyes.</p> <p>What a ruthless man. He just destroyed his hard work for more than ten years!</p> <p>The surrounding warriors were jealous and admired him.</p> <p>They admired Xie Fei for his courage and envied him for becoming a disciple of a martial arts legend.</p> <p>Everyone present looked at Chen Ye.</p> <p>Now the pressure was on Chen Ye.</p> <p>They wanted to see what choice this mysterious man wearing a silver mask would make.</p> <p>Would he quit or choose to destroy his internal strength?</p> <p>Chen Ye sat on the chair without moving.</p> <p>He didn't have any internal strength, so how could he destroy it?</p> <p>Seeing that Chen Ye did not move, the people around could not help but whisper.</p> <p>"Is he hesitating?"</p> <p>"Think about it, he must have practiced his internal skills for more than ten years. He really wouldn't want to give up."</p> <p>"The most important thing is to practice again, which may take another ten years."&#160;</p> <p>"The internal skills of Daoism are most concerned with the foundation. If you want to return to the second level, it may not be done in more than ten years."</p> <p>Master Huoyun held the white jade pearl in his hand and stared at Chen Ye.</p> <p>He wanted to see how he would choose.</p> <p>Chen Ye's elusive body movement left a deep impression on him.</p> <p>Just as everyone was waiting for Chen Ye to make a move, Zhang Zhiling said lightly: "Please follow me, both of you."&#160;</p> <p>As soon as these words came out, everyone present was stunned.</p> <p>Chen Ye had not yet given up his internal strength, so why did Zhang Zhiling let him pass?</p> <p>"Senior Zhang! He hasn't given up his internal strength yet!"</p> <p>"Yes! Why did he pass?"</p> <p>"Why?"</p> <p>Someone among the surrounding warriors shouted, jealousy imminent on their faces.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling glanced at the man who spoke lightly.</p> <p>The man was silent immediately, like a duck with its neck held. He did not dare to speak at all.</p> <p>"He has already dissolved it himself." Zhang Zhiling responded lightly.</p> <p>After speaking, he looked at Hong Jinlei.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei nodded in understanding, and said in a thunderous voice: "Everyone, the disciple selection is over."</p> <p>"Please follow me out of the Villa!"</p> <p>The warriors around heard Zhang Zhiling's response, and they were all stunned on the spot, looking at each other.</p> <p>"What?"</p> <p>"He has dissolved it?"</p> <p>"Hiss... When?"</p> <p>"Why didn't I see it?"</p> <p>"Did he dissolve it long before Xie Fei?"</p> <p>The warriors couldn't help whispering to each other.</p> <p>They were very confused and couldn't figure out when Chen Ye dissolved his internal strength.</p> <p>Hong Jinlei coughed, and the sound like thunder resounded in everyone's ears.</p> <p>The warriors quieted down and followed Hong Jinlei out of the reception hall.</p> <p>Chen Ye was still sitting on the chair. He took a deep look at Zhang Zhiling who was sitting in the main seat.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling had a peaceful expression, calm eyes, and an extraordinary temperament.</p> <p>The words of the little blind man came to Chen Ye's mind. "It's useless to go there. The person has already been chosen."&#160;</p> <p>The person has already been chosen.</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly felt a sense of subtlety. Why did he feel that the person who was chosen was himself?</p> <p>But this was impossible. Chen Ye transmigrated two months ago and it was impossible for him to know Zhang Zhiling.&#160;</p> <p>"Please follow me, both of you." Zhang Zhiling stood up from the main seat, his tone was still gentle, without the airs of the legendary martial arts master.&#160;</p> <p>Chen Ye stood up and followed behind Zhang Zhiling with Xie Fei. In front of the reception hall.&#160;</p> <p>Master Huoyun looked back at Chen Ye's back and shook his head: "It's a pity. He has such great qinggong."&#160;</p> <p>Peng Tong, the Shanxi Tiger Dwarf, stared at Chen Ye and Xie Fei with a gloomy look, and his expression was strange.&#160;&#160;</p> <p>"Two people? Why are there two people?" The little blind man held a wooden stick in his left hand and walked carefully. He murmured in a low voice: "Isn't it already chosen? There is only one person? Strange, strange."&#160;</p> <p>The little blind man reached into his arms with his right hand and his fingers touched three copper coins. After thinking for a while, the little blind man suddenly had an ominous premonition in his heart.&#160;</p> <p>It was as if he would be retaliated by the secrets of heaven as long as he told the fortune.&#160;</p> <p>The little blind man shuddered, resisted the urge to tell the fortune, and followed the crowd to leave the reception hall.&#160;&#160;</p> <p>Chen Ye and Xie Fei followed Zhang Zhiling through the reception hall and came to the back room. Zhang Zhiling looked at Xie Fei and said lightly, "You go down first."&#160;</p> <p>"Yes." Xie Fei bowed respectfully, his face was as pale as paper, and there was a trace of blood on the corner of his mouth.&#160;</p> <p>He did not look at Chen Ye, turned around, and walked away with firm steps.&#160;</p> <p>Seeing this scene, Chen Ye felt like he was struck by thunder, his eyes widened.&#160;</p> <p>Xie Fei is Zhang Zhiling's man!&#160;</p> <p>At this moment, Chen Ye suddenly understood. The one that the little blind man said was destined to be him!&#160;</p> <p>How is this possible?&#160;</p> <p>The development of the situation was beyond Chen Ye's expectations. But what happened next surprised Chen Ye even more!&#160;</p> <p>Only Chen Ye and Zhang Zhiling were left in the back room. Zhang Zhiling looked serious. He bowed to Chen Ye and saluted respectfully.</p> <p>Yuyu: Okay, that was unexpected&#8230; I like it.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Tieque Villa, the back room of the reception hall.</p> <p>"So..."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked strange, looking at the respectful Zhang Zhiling in front of him and said, "In twenty years, you want me to protect Tieque Villa?"</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling said seriously, "That's right!"</p> <p>After listening to Zhang Zhiling's explanation of the cause and effect, Chen Ye felt it was absurd.</p> <p>Three months ago, the leader of the Shenji Sect made a prediction, predicting that there would be a great disaster in the Jianghu in twenty years.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling had practiced Daoism for many years, and he felt something in his heart. He also used the Taoist tortoise divination technique to make a divination for Tieque Villa.</p> <p>The divination was very ominous. A fallen nest and signs of destruction.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling didn't believe it, and he made three divinations in a row, all showing that Tieque Villa would be destroyed in twenty years.</p> <p>Everyone in the manor was slaughtered, and no one was alive.</p> <p>Even though Zhang Zhiling was in Jianghu twenty years ago and had experienced countless storms, he was at a loss and helpless when he saw this situation.</p> <p>He took the risk of prying into the secrets of heaven and made another divination.</p> <p>It gave Tieque Villa a glimmer of hope. The secrets of heaven are vague and cannot be peeped into, but Zhang Zhiling used the authentic Daoist deduction method.</p> <p>There are fifty great ways, forty-nine are derived from heaven, and one is created by man.</p> <p>He used his own lifespan to divine the way to survive.</p> <p>"So, spreading the news in the martial arts world that you want to accept a successor on July 4th, is to find me?" Chen Ye had a strange expression.</p> <p>He never expected that the martial arts legend from twenty years ago, Qing Xuzi, Zhang Zhiling, came up with the trick of "successor" to find him.</p> <p>"How do you know I will definitely come?" Chen Ye looked at Zhang Zhiling and asked curiously.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling sighed and said, "I don't know."</p> <p>"The hexagram shows that there is only a 30 out of a 100 chance that I can find you."</p> <p>When he said this, he couldn't help but smile bitterly and said, "I don't even know if you are a man or a woman, what you look like, how good your martial arts are..."</p> <p>"I only know that on the fourth of July this year, there is a glimmer of hope for Tieque Villa. The hope and I have a cause and effect of inheritance."</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling's eyes showed helplessness and luck. He finally found the person shown on the hexagram.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked deeply at Zhang Zhiling in front of him.</p> <p>At this moment, Qing Xuzi didn't look like a martial arts legend. He was just an ordinary middle-aged man who was worried about his family.</p> <p>"This is gambling." Chen Ye said lightly.</p> <p>"But I won the bet." Zhang Zhiling looked at Chen Ye with a firm look in his eyes.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat on a chair in the back room, tapped the table with his fingers, and said lightly: "Is Xie Fei your man?"</p> <p>"He is from the Guandong&#8217;s Xie family. I had him as a backup." Zhang Zhiling did not sit down, but stood in front of Chen Ye and explained: "If we can't find you, the Innate Qi Skill cannot fall into the hands of side doors and others with left-handed methods." </p> <p>"So Xie Fei didn't dissolve his internal strength?"</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling nodded: "Except for the first-grade realm, that can see whether you have dissolved your internal strength, others can't see it."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled: "Interesting, how do you know that the person you are looking for is me?"</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling also smiled: "You don't have internal strength, but you can pass the first selection. I have been traveling in the Jianghu for several years and reading all the Taoist classics. I have never seen such a situation."</p> <p>"How long can you live?" Chen Ye suddenly asked.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling looked serious and held up three fingers: "Three days."</p> <p>Is this the price of prying into the secrets of heaven?</p> <p>Chen Ye heard from the little blind boy on the road that Zhang Zhiling practiced the Innate Qi Skill, and when he reached perfection, his life span could easily exceed a hundred years.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling is only in his forties now, but he only has three days left to live.</p> <p>"Although the method of deduction is magical, every time you pry into the secrets of heaven, you will pay a price."</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling sighed and said, "Young Master is not an ordinary person. I used the tortoise shell to predict the fate of Tieque Villa three times, and the price was only three years of life."</p> <p>"But the divination of that ray of life exhausted my life span."</p> <p>Chen Ye's expression changed slightly.</p> <p>Is the reason why Zhang Zhiling is dying because of him?</p> <p>Could it be related to the system?</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered secretly.</p> <p>If you want to predict him, you will pay a huge price?</p> <p>Chen Ye was silent for a moment, then said calmly: "You want me to help you, what price can you pay?"</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling took out a two-finger-thick book from his arms, put it on the table next to Chen Ye, and said solemnly: "This is Innate Qi Skill."</p> <p>"It is rumored in the Jianghu that this skill was created by me, but it is not true. Back then, I read all the classics of the three sects of Daoism and found that there were three sections of content that were consistent within the three sects. I realized that there was a mystery inside, and spent two years extracting this volume of "Innate Qi Skill" from it."</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling took a deep breath and said slowly: "This is authentic Daoism, and the source cannot be traced. Because I practiced the internal skills of the three sects of Daoism, my internal strength came from the skill, so I could barely practice it."</p> <p>"But in the end, it was a change of skills, and I could only practice to great success and enter the first-grade realm. I could never break through the master realm in my life."</p> <p>At this point, Zhang Zhiling's tone was a little lonely and emotional.</p> <p>Chen Ye picked up the two-finger-thick "Innate Qi Skill" and flipped through it twice.</p> <p>He felt strange.</p> <p>The top-notch inner strength method in the martial arts world was now in front of him. And it was Zhang Zhiling who offered it to him.</p> <p>Chen Ye felt a little unreal, as if he was in a dream.</p> <p>"I have not passed this skill to the three sects of Daoism. The one in front of you is the only one in the world."</p> <p>Seeing that Chen Ye was unmoved, Zhang Zhiling took a deep breath.</p> <p>In one breath, he said, "In addition to this skill, I am willing to pass on my lifelong internal strength to you."</p> <p>"Within two hours, you will have forty years of innate internal strength and become a top-level master in the world."</p> <p>"But this method has its flaws. The internal strength is not cultivated by you, so you will stop at the first level like me."</p> <p>"Or, I will use my internal strength to strengthen your muscles and marrow and lay the foundation for the skill. In the future, you will get twice the result with half the effort when practicing the "Innate Qi Skill."</p> <p>Chen Ye was silent, and his fingers that were tapping the table stopped.</p> <p>Suddenly, Zhang Zhiling looked outside the door and said coldly, "Who is it?"</p> <p>The red painted wooden door of the back room was slowly pushed open, revealing a little head.</p> <p>It was a little girl with two hair buns.</p> <p>The little girl looked three or four years old, with a delicate and graceful figure and a pair of clear black eyes, looking very lovely.</p> <p>"Daddy..." the little girl shouted crisply.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling's cold expression softened, and he said softly, "Xuanxuan, go find your mother. Daddy has something to do now."</p> <p>"Daddy said he would fly a kite with Xuanxuan..." The little girl named Xuanxuan pouted, somewhat dissatisfied.</p> <p>"Xuanxuan!" Zhang Zhiling stiffened his face and was about to scold.</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled and said, "Since you promised the child, you must keep your word."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at the little girl standing at the door and smiled, "Little girl, stand outside the door and count a hundred. After counting, your daddy will take you to fly a kite."</p> <p>"Really?" The little girl's big black eyes showed joy.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling glanced at Chen Ye and nodded at his daughter.</p> <p>"Okay! Daddy is not allowed to lie to Xuanxuan this time!" The little girl ran outside and closed the door.</p> <p>The sound of counting came from outside the door.</p> <p>"One, two, three..."</p> <p>The back room fell silent again.</p> <p>Chen Ye said to Zhang Zhiling calmly: "Other people's internal strength is always theirs."</p> <p>"I've taken the skills away. If there is a disaster in Tieque Villa in twenty years, I will help."</p> <p>After saying that, Chen Ye paused for a moment, and he glanced at Zhang Zhiling: "You don't have much time left, spend more time with your family. If this internal strength has nowhere to go, you might as well build a solid foundation for your daughter."</p> <p>Chen Ye bowed slightly and took a step.</p> <p>He appeared in front of the door of the back room in an instant and pushed it open.</p> <p>"Twenty, twenty-one, twenty-three..."</p> <p>The little girl with two buns stood by the door, counting on her fingers.</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled at this: "Your father said he knew he was wrong and planned to go fly a kite with you in advance."</p> <p>"You don't have to count, your father is waiting for you inside, go quickly."</p> <p>The little girl opened her eyes wide, her face full of surprise: "Really?"</p> <p>The little girl leaned over to look at the back room.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling stood there, with a hint of confusion in his eyes.</p> <p>"Go quickly." Chen Ye pushed the little girl gently.</p> <p>"Daddy!" The little girl ran into the back room and hugged Zhang Zhiling's legs.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked back at Zhang Zhiling and said nothing.</p> <p>One step forward, the ground shrunk into an inch.</p> <p>The figure appeared thirty feet away.</p> <p>After a breath, the figure disappeared.</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling looked out the door absentmindedly, with shock in his eyes.</p> <p>In an instant, he crossed thirty feet.</p> <p>This kind of light skill, even the master may not be able to do it?</p> <p>What's more, that person has no internal force!</p> <p>"There is such a strange person in the world..." Zhang Zhiling looked outside and sighed.</p> <p>The other party actually looked down on the internal force that he had cultivated for his whole life.</p> <p>From the sound, the man should be only about twenty years old.</p> <p>"In twenty years..."</p> <p>At this moment, Zhang Zhiling's eyes were as hot as flames.</p> <p>He now believed that the Tieque Villa in twenty years would be safe and sound under the protection of that person.</p> <p>"Daddy... Daddy... You lied to Xuanxuan again."</p> <p>Zhang Zhiling came to his senses when he heard his daughter's dissatisfied voice beside his legs.</p> <p>A smile appeared on his gentle face, and he laughed heartily and picked up his daughter.</p> <p>"Okay Xuanxuan, Daddy will take you to fly a kite right now!"</p> <p>A moment later.</p> <p>A swallow kite flew over Tieque Villa. A middle-aged man held a little girl in his arms, holding the kite string in his hand. The little girl's silver bell-like laughter echoed interlaced with the middle-aged man&#8217;s gruff one.</p> <p>No one would associate the middle-aged man in front of him with the legendary figure who roamed the world 20 years ago.</p> <p>He was just an ordinary father.</p> <p>A father who cared about his family.</p> <p>TL Notes:</p> <p>Red Painted Wooden Door</p> <p>Little Girl with Two Buns</p> <p>Swallow Kite</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Longmen Inn, Room No. 1.</p> <p>"Senior, it's useless to catch me... Master Hua and I just met by chance! We're really not familiar with each other!"</p> <p>The little blind boy with a black cloth wrapped around his eyes sat on the stool with a depressed look on his face.</p> <p>He never thought that one day he would be targeted by a top-level master.</p> <p>Peng Tong, the Shanxi Tiger Dwarf, stepped on the stool with both feet. His face was gloomy and he glanced at the door from time to time, as if waiting for something.</p> <p>"Shut up, if you say more, I'll press your mute acupoint." Peng Tong was annoyed by the little blind boy's chattering and shouted hoarsely.</p> <p>The little blind boy closed his mouth in dismay.</p> <p>The room fell into silence.</p> <p>After a long while.</p> <p>"Are you really not familiar with that kid?" Peng Tong asked anxiously with limited patience.</p> <p>The little blind boy nodded: "Really not familiar."</p> <p>Then he told how he met Chen Ye.</p> <p>Hearing that Chen Ye could scare Xu Xiaolin away, Peng Tong frowned.</p> <p>He had also heard of the name of the Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin.</p> <p>"Where on earth did this guy come from?" Peng Tong muttered to himself.</p> <p>He had never heard of the name "Donghua" in the martial arts world.</p> <p>"Senior, please forgive me for saying a few words. Master Donghua has abolished his internal strength and is now the successor of Zhang Zhiling. I am not familiar with him. He really won't come back." The little blind boy said earnestly.</p> <p>Peng Tong sneered: "Abandoned his own internal strength? Although I am not good at internal strength, I can see that he and Xie Fei are both acting. They didn't abolish their own internal strength at all. They can deceive others, but not me."</p> <p>The little blind boy was stunned when he heard this, and muttered: "Didn't abolish their own internal strength?"</p> <p>"Both of them were acting..."</p> <p>"Hiss..."</p> <p>The little blind boy was stunned for a moment, and suddenly felt that his brain was not enough.</p> <p>He couldn't figure out what was going on.</p> <p>"Did I calculate it wrong again?" The little blind boy frowned, looking frustrated.</p> <p>Before going down the mountain, he had calculated a hexagram, and the hexagram clearly showed that there should be only one successor to Zhang Zhiling's mantle.</p> <p>Now there are two.</p> <p>"Not good enough, not good enough..." The little blind boy sighed.</p> <p>Peng Tong heard the little blind boy mumbling, and said impatiently: "What nonsense are you talking about?"</p> <p>The little blind boy shuddered and hurriedly said: "It's nothing, senior. I said that my Daoism is not good enough."</p> <p>Peng Tong glanced at the little blind boy, believing that he and Chen Ye were not close, and snorted coldly.</p> <p>He exerted force with his legs, and his short body turned into a black shadow, jumped out of the window directly, and disappeared.</p> <p>"Senior?"</p> <p>"Senior?"</p> <p>The little blind boy tried to shout twice, but there was no response. He breathed a sigh of relief and whispered: "Finally he left."</p> <p>Peng Tong came to his door just now, which really scared him.</p> <p>"Is it Master Donghua or Xie Fei?"</p> <p>The little blind boy said to himself with a sad face.</p> <p>He reached his hand into his arms and wanted to tell a fortune, but as soon as this thought came to his mind, he felt cold all over.</p> <p>"It can't be told, it can't be told..."</p> <p>The little blind boy felt it in his heart and took his hand out decisively.</p> <p>"Alas&#8230; I didn't seize this opportunity, and I don't know where the next opportunity will be..."</p> <p>The little blind boy lay on the table with a sad face, his expression depressed.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Jiangning County, outside the city.</p> <p>Horses neighed and galloped away on the official road.</p> <p>Qing Xuzi, Zhang Zhiling has accepted a successor, so the warriors gathered in Jiangning County no longer stayed.</p> <p>Chen Ye took off his mask and changed into a white shirt. He walked on the road, looking at the horses going away with a calm expression.</p> <p>The result of this trip was far beyond his expectations.</p> <p>The most important thing was the Innate Qi Skill.</p> <p>This top-level martial arts method in the legends of the Jianghu actually fell into his hands.</p> <p>And in the martial arts legend from twenty years ago, Qing Xuzi, Zhang Zhiling wanted to pass on his internal force to him to help him change his muscles and marrow.</p> <p>If this is said outside, he will definitely be regarded as a lunatic.</p> <p>"Other people's internal force is still other people's internal force. It's better to practice it slowly by yourself. What's more, I have a system." Chen Ye muttered to himself as he walked.</p> <p>The main reason why he refused Zhang Zhiling's help was that he had confidence in the system.</p> <p>When the system draws an attacking skill one day, he, Chen Ye, will be able to stand up on the spot.</p> <p>With the previous experience of &#8216;Indestructible Diamond&#8217; and &#8216;Ground Shrinking Step&#8217;, Chen Ye believes that if he draws an attacking skill, it must be awesome.</p> <p>Chen Ye accepted the Innate Qi Skill mainly because he wanted to practice it himself and satisfy his addiction to practicing martial arts.</p> <p>When he has internal strength, Chen Ye wants to try the moves mentioned in the martial arts novels he read before.</p> <p>For example, the sword energy is released, the ladder cloud is vertical, the swallow three times to copy the water, the roar of the mountains and rivers, etc.</p> <p>These are all impossible to do with inner strength.</p> <p>After taking a last look at Jiangning County, Chen Ye took a step and activated &#8216;Ground Shrinking Step&#8217;.</p> <p>He did not go to Tian Jizi again before leaving, although he had a good time with him these two days.</p> <p>Through the little blind boy, Chen Ye learned a lot of martial arts common sense.</p> <p>He also had the idea of &#8203;&#8203;taking the little blind boy into the orphanage, but changed his mind.</p> <p>This would expose his true identity.</p> <p>Chen Ye is Chen Ye, Donghua is Donghua.</p> <p>There are three other children in the family, so the identities must be separated. In the Jianghu, he is Master Donghua.</p> <p>In Yuhang County, he is Director Chen Ye.</p> <p>"After walking for a day, Da Ming and Xiao Lian should be worried, right?"</p> <p>Chen Ye murmured, trotting towards Yuhang County.</p> <p>More than ten minutes later.</p> <p>The familiar blue-gray city wall of Yuhang County appeared in Chen Ye's eyes. He did not stop and stepped into the city.</p> <p>&#8230; </p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>"Da Ming, why didn't you come to see me today?" </p> <p>Da Ming's "future father-in-law", Zhang Long stood at the door of the orphanage and asked with a smile on his face.</p> <p>Usually, after Da Ming had his meal at the Orphanage, he would go to Zhang Long with his small axe.</p> <p>The two would go up the mountain to chop wood together.</p> <p>Today, after noon, Da Ming didn't go to see Zhang Long. Zhang Long thought something had happened to Da Ming, so he hurried over to see.</p> <p>Zhang Long regarded this future son-in-law more seriously than his own daughter.</p> <p>Chen Daming sat on the threshold of the small courtyard of the Orphanage and smiled innocently, "I am waiting for the director to come back."</p> <p>After Chen Ye gave Daming the skill &#8216;Great Wisdom Appears Foolish&#8217;, Da Ming's wisdom and ability were improved. Except for looking silly, his speech and other things were no different from those of ordinary children.</p> <p>"Mr. Chen went out?"</p> <p>Zhang Long reacted at this time. He did not see Chen Ye, who usually sat in the shade reading a book.</p> <p>"Uncle Zhang, Director said that he had something to do and went out."</p> <p>Xiao Lian's voice came from the yard.</p> <p>She was holding a small wooden basin with clothes in her arms, and walked out of the yard lightly.</p> <p>"Oh, that's it."</p> <p>Zhang Long understood. He nodded and said, "Okay, then I'll go first."</p> <p>"I'll come back when Mr. Chen comes back."</p> <p>Zhang Long breathed a sigh of relief when he learned that Da Ming was fine. He put the axe on his waist and left.</p> <p>Xiao Lian glanced at Daming who was sitting on the doorstep and sighed, "Da Ming, I'm going to wash clothes. If Xiaofu cries, you can help me by comforting her. "</p> <p>Da Ming nodded vigorously, indicating that he understood.</p> <p>He stared at the street corner, blankly.</p> <p>Suddenly, Xiao Lian noticed that Da Ming's eyes were wide open, and there seemed to be a light in his eyes.</p> <p>Daming stood up quickly and ran not far away.</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked back and saw Chen Ye, who was dressed in white and had a handsome face and a gentle smile on his face, appearing at the street corner.</p> <p>Xiao Lian couldn't help but smile.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"Dean, as soon as you left, Daming sat on the doorstep and stared at the street corner for a whole day."</p> <p>Xiao Lian reported the situation to Chen Ye with a smile on her face.</p> <p>Chen Ye rubbed Daming's head twice with a smile on his face when he heard it: "Really? Daddy loved you well."</p> <p>As he said that, Chen Ye took out three strings of candied haws from behind and handed one to Daming.</p> <p>Daming's eyes lit up when he saw the red candied haws. He took the candied haws and took a bite.</p> <p>The red fruit wrapped in light yellow syrup was instantly bitten in half by Daming.</p> <p>A look of satisfaction appeared on his little face: "Thank you, Daddy!"</p> <p>"Xiao Lian, this is yours."</p> <p>Chen Ye handed another candied haws to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's fair face turned slightly red, and she frowned and said: "Dean, I am not a child anymore."</p> <p>"Come on, one string for each of the three of us." Chen Ye said with a smile.</p> <p>He knew Xiao Lian was embarrassed, but in fact she also liked to eat candied haws.</p> <p>Xiao Lian hesitated for a moment, took the candied haws, took a small bite like a lady, and said crisply: "Thank you, Dean."</p> <p>Chen Ye chewed the candied haws in his mouth and said vaguely: "You're welcome."</p> <p>"You want to wash clothes? Don't worry, go after you finish eating."</p> <p>Chen Ye subconsciously put his left hand on Xiao Lian's shoulder.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's fair face turned red.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't realize that his action made Xiao Lian blush. In his heart, Xiao Lian was just a 13-year-old child. But in ancient times, people got married at the age of 13.</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn't think so. She secretly glanced at Chen Ye's profile, lowered her head, and her cheeks became more rosy.</p> <p>After eating the candied haws, Xiao Lian left the orphanage with a wooden basin to wash clothes.</p> <p>Daming did a handstand with one hand and showed the results of his exercise to Chen Ye.</p> <p>After Chen Ye praised him a few times, Daming showed a silly smile on his face and happily continued to exercise in the yard.</p> <p>Xiaofu was still sleeping quietly in bed.</p> <p>Chen Ye took out the Innate Qi Skill, sat on the recliner, and flipped through the pages one by one.</p> <p>No one would have thought that in a small orphanage in Yuhang County, someone would be reading the top secret book in the martial arts world.</p> <p>"The inner power mental method is the same as the weapon method and palm method. It is divided into five realms: initial glimpse, minor success, entry into the hall, major success, and perfection. Corresponding to the five realms of inferior, fourth grade, third grade, second grade, and first grade."</p> <p>"Huh? Oh!"</p> <p>"Innate Qi Skill has one more realm than ordinary first-grade skills?"</p> <p>"There is also a human acupuncture point map..."</p> <p>Chen Ye memorized while flipping through it.</p> <p>The basic knowledge of martial arts was gradually completed.</p> <p>Slowly, Chen Ye sat cross-legged on the bed, closed his eyes, and silently recited the mental method in his heart: "Yuxu Palace internal guiding exercise, internal training of the five internal organs to lead the five elements..." </p> <p>After a moment of breathing, a weak heat flow came from the lower abdomen.</p> <p>Chen Ye opened his eyes in surprise.</p> <p>According to the description in the book, he has already felt the embryonic form of internal power.</p> <p>When he keeps practicing the mental method and gathers the first internal force, he will enter the realm of a second-rate warrior.</p> <p>"It seems that I still have some talent."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled. Just as he was about to continue practicing the mental method, he heard Xiao Lian coming back with a wooden basin.</p> <p>"Forget it, I'll practice in the evening."</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't want to show his strength in front of Xiao Lian.</p> <p>According to the principle of separation of identities, he is the dean of the Orphanage and an ordinary person.</p> <p>It's like how Xiao Lian is hiding it from him.</p> <p>In the evening, after dinner, the three of them were busy with their own things.</p> <p>Xiao Lian returned to the room, while taking care of Xiaofu, she sat cross-legged on the bed to practice the Rain Technique Manual of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>Daming ran to the library and continued to read his comic books.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat cross-legged on his bed and continued to practice Innate Qi Skill.</p> <p>In a blink of an eye, the night became deep.</p> <p>After Chen Ye washed up, he blew out the oil lamp and sat cross-legged on the bed. Just as he was about to practice, the cold mechanical sound of the system rang in his ears.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Daily settlement is open!]</p> <p>[You left the orphanage. Xiao Lian and Daming got up early and finished breakfast independently. They had a full meal]</p> <p>[Daming finished his meal and sat on the threshold waiting for you to come back]</p> <p>[Xiao Lian coaxed Xiaofu to play. In her spare time, she practiced Tang Sect hidden weapon techniques with stones]</p> <p>[Xiaofu was tired and fell asleep. She slept soundly.

Why did it suddenly increase so much?"</p> <p>Chen Ye was a little surprised. This was an unexpected surprise.</p> <p>"Why is Xiao Lian's gratitude increasing in a different way from Daming?"</p> <p>Chen Ye touched his chin, unable to figure it out.</p> <p>Daming's gratitude is gradual, increasing by 1% every few days, and after reaching 80%, it stopped.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's is a leap-forward growth, increasing by a certain amount at irregular intervals, without any rules.</p> <p>After checking the daily report, Chen Ye sat cross-legged and continued to practice Innate Qi Skill.</p> <p>Three days later, Juke Restaurant.</p> <p>"Speaking of the mysterious young man wearing a silver mask, he just finished talking to Hong Jinlei, and his figure appeared in front of the villa."</p> <p>"The warriors present were all shocked by this miraculous qinggong, their eyes were wide open and they were stunned."</p> <p>The storyteller Old Man Liu spoke, his tone was sometimes rapid and sometimes slow.</p> <p>It was vivid, just like he was there that day.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat in the hall, threw two peanuts into his mouth, and listened with relish.</p> <p>In three days, the news that Zhang Zhiling had accepted two successors spread throughout the world.</p> <p>Among them, the "Donghua" master wearing a silver mask also became famous in the Jianghu. There are many different opinions about him. Some say that he is a disciple of a hermit master, and some say that he accidentally ate a strange object when he was young. There are all kinds of different opinions.</p> <p>But the only consistent thing is the praise of the warriors for his "miraculous" qinggong.</p> <p>According to the warriors present that day, the young master Donghua came and went without a trace, and when he performed qinggong, he could not be seen at all.</p> <p>Qiong Aohai, the young master of the Haijing Gang, was happy to see an equal and wanted to have a fight with the young master Donghua.</p> <p>The young master Donghua ignored him.</p> <p>The young master Qiong was afraid of the young master Donghua's qinggong, and finally did not make a move.</p> <p>Anyway, the situation that day became more and more outrageous.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't know whether to laugh or cry when he heard it.</p> <p>The real situation that day has deviated from the truth by people's word of mouth.</p> <p>However, some people felt sorry for the mysterious "Young Master Donghua". His internal strength was wasted and he had to rebuild it. He would not be able to see his miraculous Qinggong again in a short time.</p> <p>Without the blessing of internal strength, the power of Qinggong and attack methods would be reduced.</p> <p>Chen Ye ate peanuts and listened to the storyteller telling his story. He felt a different kind of pleasure in his heart.</p> <p>If he wore a mask and appeared in the restaurant, he would probably scare this storyteller with a special identity.</p> <p>Of course, this was just Chen Ye's fantasy.</p> <p>He would not expose his other identity.</p> <p>The storyteller on the wooden table finished the story of "Young Master Donghua", picked up the teacup, and took a sip to moisten his throat.</p> <p>"Next, I will tell you a new story."</p> <p>Hearing the storyteller say this, all the diners in the restaurant pricked up their ears and prepared to listen.</p> <p>Since Old Liu finished telling the story of Zhang Zhiling's apprenticeship, a lot of news has also come from Jiangning County. Most of them are consistent with the story told by Old Liu.</p> <p>The diners realized that Old Liu's identity was probably not ordinary.</p> <p>Chen Ye also perked up. Old Liu was his channel for getting information about the underworld.</p> <p>"In recent days, the gold medal killer Yu Luosha betrayed Fengyu Tower."</p> <p>Hearing this, Chen Ye felt like he was struck by lightning.</p> <p>Yu Luosha betrayed Fengyu Tower? What happened?</p> <p>Chen Ye suppressed his doubts and continued to listen.</p> <p>"Yu Luosha is a martial arts expert. She assassinated a steward of Jiangning Mansion. Fengyu Tower expelled her from the organization and sent people to hunt her down."</p> <p>The storyteller Old Liu spoke eloquently and began to tell a fictional fight. The two sides were Yu Luosha and the nameless steward.</p> <p>Chen Ye frowned after listening to a few sentences. The only useful content was this sentence:</p> <p>Yu Luosha killed a steward and was then expelled from Fengyu Tower. Now, many assassins are hunting her down.</p> <p>TL Notes:</p> <p>Candied Haws:</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Yuhang County, outside the city.</p> <p>Several horses neighed and ran quickly on the official road, raising a cloud of dust.</p> <p>A woman in a black dress, holding a sword in her left hand and wearing a veil on her face, walked quietly on the official road.</p> <p>The back of her hand holding the sword was white, and the blue shark skin scabbard reflected a dark blue color under the sunlight.</p> <p>Beside the official road, there was a teahouse for resting. The flag on the wooden pole, three or four feet high in front of the door, fluttered in the wind.</p> <p>The woman walked into the teahouse and found a bench to sit down on.</p> <p>The small shop was not big, and there were two peddlers sitting inside. They put baskets of goods at their feet and drank tea with only tea foam in big gulps.</p> <p>When the tea maker saw another customer coming in, he raised his head slightly, straightened his hunched body subconsciously, and then bent down again.</p> <p>The woman sat on the bench and did not order tea. The tea maker did not go over to serve her. The two seemed to have a tacit understanding, waiting for the peddlers to leave.</p> <p>Soon, the two vendors drank enough water and rested enough. They picked up the baskets on the ground again, put them on their backs, and left the teahouse.</p> <p>An old and hoarse voice sounded in the quiet teahouse. "You still dared to come here?"</p> <p>"Why not?" The woman's calm voice sounded.</p> <p>Deacon Huang, who was disguised as a tea maker in the teahouse, smiled. He straightened his back, walked to the opposite side of the woman, and sat on the stool.</p> <p>"Did you kill Deacon Li from Jiangning Mansion?"</p> <p>"Yes, I killed him."</p> <p>After getting the answer, Deacon Huang was silent for a moment, and said in a tone of some regret: "Do you know what it means to do this?"</p> <p>"Betraying Fengyu Tower?" The woman's tone was still calm.</p> <p>Deacon Huang sighed: "You know that, and you still did it."</p> <p>"I didn't betray Fengyu Tower. It wasn't me who betrayed Fengyu Tower." The woman said in a firm tone.</p> <p>Deacon Huang didn't speak.</p> <p>"I want to see the owner of the building. Give me a token." The woman stated the purpose of her trip.</p> <p>Deacon Huang still didn't speak.</p> <p>A voice sounded from behind the woman. "You won't see the owner anymore."</p> <p>It was a man's voice, deep, steady and powerful.</p> <p>The woman slowly turned her head and saw a lazy man leaning against the flagpole of the teahouse.</p> <p>The man was wearing a jute shirt worn by ordinary people, holding a reed stalk in his mouth, and a long knife with a black sheath on his waist.</p> <p>He looked ordinary, with a lazy and tired look on his face.</p> <p>"Huang San." The woman read out the man's name, looked at Deacon Huang and asked, "Is this your confidence?"</p> <p>Deacon Huang was silent for a moment and said, "I knew you would come to me."</p> <p>"Since you killed Deacon Li, it means that you have found out something after all."</p> <p>The woman looked at the old man calmly: "Are you afraid?"</p> <p>Deacon Huang nodded: "Your sword is too fast, I don't want to die yet."</p> <p>"But his sword is as fast as yours."</p> <p>Deacon Huang looked at the man leaning against the flagpole, with relief in his eyes, looking at the man as if he was looking at his own successor.</p> <p>The woman did not speak, she gently pushed the hilt of the sword with her left thumb, revealing an inch of the blade, and infused her internal force into the sword.</p> <p>Biting chill emitted from the sword. A cold light flashed in Deacon Huang's eyes.</p> <p>He narrowed his eyes slightly, and his body stiffened slightly.</p> <p>Although she hadn't drawn her sword yet, he felt that his whole body was covered by the cold sword tip.</p> <p>Deacon Huang's face turned slightly pale, and he shouted hurriedly: "Why don't you do it?"</p> <p>The man with the reed stalk in his mouth walked slowly, and on the way, he spit out the grass roots in his mouth.</p> <p>Huang San did not draw his sword, he walked calmly in front of Deacon Huang. Deacon Huang noticed something wrong, and his expression changed slightly.</p> <p>Huang San looked at him with calm eyes: "In fact, I also want to know what is happening to Fengyu Tower."</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Orphanage</p> <p>Xiao Lian sat cross-legged on the bed, slowly opened her eyes, and exhaled a turbid air.</p> <p>She had just run the Rain Character Technique for a week, and felt that the internal force in her dantian had grown a little stronger. Her pretty face showed sincere joy.</p> <p>"If this continues, I can enter the fourth level in a few days."</p> <p>It has been more than a month since she got the Rain Character Technique of Fengyu Tower. With daily practice, Xiao Lian has produced nine strands of internal force in her body.</p> <p>When she has nurtured her internal strength to ten strands, she can practice the second level of the Rain Art and enter the "minor success realm".</p> <p>Compared with the improvement of internal strength, Xiao Lian is more pleased with the progress of the "Floating Rain Body Technique" and the "General Outline of Tang Sect's Hidden Weapons".</p> <p>The General Outline of Tang Sect's Hidden Weapons just entered the "minor success" realm from "initial glimpse of the door" yesterday.</p> <p>The Floating Rain Body Technique is also about to enter the "mastery" from "minor success".</p> <p>Overall, Xiao Lian's current strength is already a solid fourth-grade late stage.</p> <p>When the Floating Rain Body Technique breaks through, she will be a third-grade warrior. When she enters the martial arts world, even if she doesn't meet a master, she can protect herself with her body technique.</p> <p>"According to what Master said, I have practiced the Tang Sect's hidden weapons to a minor success, and several hidden weapons are enough to kill a third-grade warrior. It's a pity that there is no Tang Sect method of refining poison in the general outline. Otherwise, if I use poison, I can deal with a second-grade master."</p> <p>Xiao Lian's pretty face showed a hint of excitement.</p> <p>The Tang Sect Hidden Weapon Guide that Qin Yi gave Xiao Lian was found by Tang Hao. It can be practiced all the way to the Great Mastery (Second Grade). It describes the use of various hidden weapons and various techniques.</p> <p>It even mentions a top-level hidden weapon technique called "Flower Rain All Over the Sky". After practicing it, more than ten kinds of hidden weapons can be launched in an instant.</p> <p>With the hidden weapons, both hands can hit 64 parts at the same time.</p> <p>After it is released, no one can stop it, and it will cause blood to flow, with unparalleled power.</p> <p>However, Xiao Lian is still far from that level now. All the time she spent practicing hidden weapons in the past month was on mastering the feel and skills of various Tang Sect hidden weapons.</p> <p>During the practice, Xiao Lian compared the Tang Sect General Principles with the Flower Finger and found that the two were simply worlds apart.</p> <p>Tang Sect is indeed the number one hidden weapon sect in the world, and it is far from being comparable to the Flower Finger of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>The Flower Finger mentioned that those who practice hidden weapons should find out a few hidden weapons that suit them and practice them specifically.</p> <p>The Tang Sect General Principles said: Those with talent can practice various hidden weapons at the same time, the more the better; if they can master them all, they can understand the true meaning of "Flower Rain All Over the Sky".</p> <p>After Xiao Lian commissioned the blacksmith to make more than ten kinds of hidden weapons, she found that she seemed to have an excellent talent for hidden weapons.</p> <p>After trying more than ten kinds of hidden weapons, no matter which one, Xiao Lian could use it with ease.</p> <p>After thinking about it, Xiao Lian decided to practice them at the same time.</p> <p>After a month, she memorized all the more than ten kinds of hidden weapon firing techniques and skills of the Tang Sect. What she lacked was flexible use and combination of various techniques.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's internal strength is now in "Entry level", her body skills are in "minor success", and her hidden weapons are in "minor success". According to the strength of the martial arts world, she is in the late stage of the fourth grade.</p> <p>However, because Xiao Lian is practicing hidden weapons, which are a way to defeat the strong with the weak, it is not difficult to kill a third-grade warrior with a sneak attack.</p> <p>When her body skills are "advanced" and she becomes a third-grade warrior, it will not be difficult to fight against a second-grade master with poison on the hidden weapons.</p> <p>"I have a good talent for hidden weapons and body skills, but I am a little worse in internal strength practice, so I can only work hard."</p> <p>"It's a pity that the production of mechanical hidden weapons is too complicated. It requires not only materials but also many steps. It is far beyond the ability of the blacksmiths in Yuhang County."</p> <p>Xiao Lian calmed down and sighed.</p> <p>The mechanical hidden weapon is the most special among all the hidden weapons. It does not require internal strength or practice of throwing techniques. It only requires materials, eyesight, and timing.</p> <p>As long as the timing is right, the mechanical hidden weapon can defeat the strong with the weak!</p> <p>Every time Xiao Lian looks at the mechanical hidden weapon section, she feels itchy and wants to try to make it herself.</p> <p>But she has no materials and no experience, so she has never tried to make a mechanical hidden weapon.</p> <p>Xiao Lian jumped out of bed and moved her body. Seeing that Xiaofu was still sleeping, she couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>Suddenly, Xiao Lian's ears moved slightly, and there was a strange footstep in the yard.</p> <p>The footsteps were very light, and there was a foundation of body movement.</p> <p>The smile on Xiao Lian's face slowly disappeared, and she walked to the door and looked out.</p> <p>She didn't know when a man in linen clothes, with ordinary looks and sinister eyes, appeared in the yard.</p> <p>A faint murderous aura came from the other party.</p> <p>Xiao Lian's pupils shrank slightly, and an idea popped up in her mind.</p> <p>It was an assassin from Fengyu Tower.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Jiangning County, Guandao Teahouse.</p> <p>Qin Yi pushed the hilt of the sword with her left hand, revealing a cold blade.</p> <p>She looked at Deacon Huang calmly.</p> <p>Deacon Huang had a gloomy face, and the veins on his neck were throbbing.</p> <p>The man named Huang San put his hands behind his chest, staring at Deacon Huang, and spoke frivolously.</p> <p>"I was in Shaoxing Prefecture and found that the fourth-grade assassins of Fengyu Tower changed their careers to kidnappers."</p> <p>"As assassins, they don't kill people anymore, which is really interesting."</p> <p>Huang San retracted his gaze, turned around, sat on the bench, and smiled: "What's more interesting is that in several nearby prefectures, the low-grade assassins of Fengyu Tower are all kidnappers."</p> <p>"Only silver and gold medal killers are still taking missions."</p> <p>Huang San picked up the cold tea on the table, poured it into the cup, and took a sip.</p> <p>"What's more interesting is that several of the younger assassins I had high hopes for are dead."&#160;</p> <p>"They're completely dead. Although those younger assassins are not very powerful, they all have their own characteristics. But all of them are dead."</p> <p>Huang San put down his teacup, looked directly at Deacon Huang, and said in a gloomy tone: "Deacon Huang, tell me. Can such a coincidence happen in this world? What are those low-level assassins doing?"</p> <p>Qin Yi, who was standing by, retracted her left thumb and sheathed her sword again. She also sat on the bench, waiting for Deacon Huang to speak.</p> <p>Deacon Huang closed his eyes and said slowly:&#160;</p> <p>"Last month, Qin Yi exchanged the handwritten copies of "Rain Character Technique" and "Rainy Body Technique" from the hall. That day, she was supposed to die at the Yuelai Inn in the south of the city. Someone said that they saw a little girl coming out of the Yuelai Inn. I just sent someone to Yuhang Orphanage."</p> <p>Qin Yi's face changed drastically after hearing this.The left hand holding the sword couldn't help but tremble.</p> <p>Deacon Huang opened his eyes again and sneered: "Since you are from Fengyu Tower, you should know the information of Fengyu Tower. The wind and rain in the world, as long as Fengyu Tower wants to hear it, it can hear it."</p> <p>Qin Yi did not hesitate, turned around and stepped on the ground, her body was as light as a bird, and she flew ten feet in the air and rushed to the city.</p> <p>Huang San still sat beside Deacon Huang and smiled: "Deacon, I have no worries. You didn't expect me to turn against you. I just want to know the reason, tell me, and I won't kill you. After all, it was you who gave me the name Huang."</p> <p>Deacon Huang showed a trace of relief on his old face, and murmured: "You still have a conscience. Unlike her, she only has Fengyu Tower in her eyes, she is loyal and brave... But she doesn't remember the old friendship."</p> <p>There was a hint of sarcasm in the last tone.</p> <p>"Since you want to hear it, then I'll tell you." Deacon Huang's eyes regained calmness and looked at Huang San again.</p> <p>The two looked at each other.</p> <p>Huang San's heart trembled.</p> <p>What kind of eyes were those?</p> <p>Deacon Huang's eyes were filled with sadness and weeping, and he felt like... an old dog who had lost his home.</p> <p>"Come out." Shi Shisan stood in the yard and said lightly.</p> <p>Xiaolian stood behind the door and took a deep breath.</p> <p>With her hearing ability, she could hear the other party, and the other party could certainly hear her.</p> <p>Xiaolian did not go out. She walked to the bed and took out a black brocade bag from under the bed.</p> <p>Inside was a heavy hidden weapon.</p> <p>After tying the hidden weapon bag behind her waist, Xiaolian pushed open the door and walked out of the room.</p> <p>Shi Shisan stood in the yard, looking at Xiaolian with sinister eyes.&#160;</p> <p>"She looks pretty good."&#160;</p> <p>He raised the corner of his mouth slightly and nodded approvingly.&#160;</p> <p>Xiao Lian remained calm: "Who are you looking for?"</p> <p>She had recognized that the other party was the one who kidnapped her two months ago. However, it seemed that the other party did not recognize her.</p> <p>"Looking for you." Shi Shisan moved his eyes away and looked at the yard, and said, "This Orphanage, the yard is not big."</p> <p>It seemed that he did not take Xiaolian seriously at all. Xiao Lian's heart sank, thinking that the other party had found out that she set fire to the house two months ago and came here for revenge.</p> <p>Xiao Lian remained calm, and her right hand silently touched her lower back.</p> <p>"If I were you, I wouldn't do meaningless things." Shi Shisan's eyes were still looking elsewhere, but he seemed to know Xiao Lian's every move.</p> <p>"I don't seem to know you, sir." Xiaolian asked with a smile, right behind her back.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p> <p>Shi Shisan said indifferently, "You don't need to know me. In a month, even if I give you the "Rain Character Technique" and "Rainy Body Technique", how far can you practice? Will you still have time to practice leg techniques and sword techniques?"</p> <p>Shi Shisan looked at Xiaolian with a little jealousy in his eyes. He didn't understand why he had been in life and death for Fengyu Tower for many years, accumulated merits, and exchanged his life for the third level of the Rain Character Technique.</p> <p>But this little girl in front of him could directly get the "Rain Character Technique Full Volume" and "Rainy Body Technique"?</p> <p>Xiaolian's heart sank slightly, and she saw the emotion in the other's eyes. It was jealousy. The jealousy that Xiaolian would never forget.</p> <p>The memories of the past were like boiling water, gurgling out of her mind.</p> <p>"Why do you deserve the master's favor? Just because of your appearance? I gave birth to a bastard child. You took my beauty, but the master still loves me!"</p> <p>"I've destroyed your skin, I wonder if the master will ever touch you again!"</p> <p>The voice of the vicious woman rang in Xiao Lian's ears.</p> <p>The hideous look of her mother before her death also emerged in her mind.</p> <p>A deep hatred flashed in Xiao Lian's eyes. The jealousy in Shi Shisan's eyes evoked the memory that Xiao Lian least wanted to recall.</p> <p>There was a flash of coldness in her eyes.</p> <p>"You are quite beautiful. It wouldn&#8217;t be so that Yu Luosha likes women, now would it?"</p> <p>"Otherwise, why did she exchange those two books of skills for you?" Shi Shisan stood in the yard, speculating maliciously.</p> <p>In his eyes, Xiao Lian was just a little lamb, powerless to resist. He could vent his dissatisfaction and malice at will.</p> <p>Xiao Lian did not speak, she just took her right hand back from behind. The nine scarce internal forces in her body flowed along the meridians of her hand and filled her fingers.</p> <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p> <p>"Thump, thump, thump..."</p> <p>Several black shadows flashed by, Shi Shisan's hair stood on end, and a great sense of crisis arose in his heart.</p> <p>He hurriedly used his body skills and moved two feet to the side. But the black shadow attacked like a thorn in the flesh, and its speed was extremely fast. The Tang Sect's hidden weapon techniques are not so easy to dodge.</p> <p>"Puchi..."</p> <p>The sound of a hard object piercing the flesh was heard.</p> <p>"Ah! "</p> <p>Shi Shisan couldn't help but scream, and he subconsciously covered his eyes with his hands.</p> <p>It was pitch black in front of his eyes, and there was a severe pain in his eyes, which was so painful that it drove people crazy.</p> <p>Suddenly, he felt a cold feeling in his throat, and the subsequent screams were blocked.</p> <p>It seemed that there was an extra hard object on his neck.</p> <p>Shi Shisan's body stiffened, and his hands moved from his eyes to his throat, and he touched a cold flying knife.</p> <p>His consciousness gradually blurred.</p> <p>Shi Shisan couldn't figure out how he died.</p> <p>He was a third-grade warrior.</p> <p>A silver assassin of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>"Swish, swish, swish..."</p> <p>The sound of hidden weapons was endless.</p> <p>Xiao Lian kept taking out hidden weapons from the hidden weapon bag with her right hand, and her dexterous and fair little hands were like butterflies flying.</p> <p>The technique was dazzling and made people feel psychedelic.</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn't react until the bag was empty. She softened and knelt on the ground with her head down.</p> <p>"Drip... Drip..." A subtle sound was heard. The ground of the courtyard was wet with tears.</p> <p>"Mother..." Xiaolian lowered her head and sobbed softly.</p> <p>Just after crying twice, she heard a familiar sound of footsteps.</p> <p>Xiaolian raised her head in a hurry and saw Daming with a small axe on his waist, standing blankly in the yard.</p> <p>"Da... Da Ming..." Xiaolian spoke a little stutteringly, and was even more at a loss.</p> <p>Daming stared at the body on the ground that was pierced like a hedgehog by hidden weapons, and suddenly smiled and said: "Bad guy?"</p> <p>"Yeah. "Xiao Lian nodded subconsciously.</p> <p>Da Ming didn't say much, he turned and walked into the east wing.</p> <p>Looking at Da Ming's departing back, Xiaolian opened her mouth, but her throat seemed to be blocked and no sound came out. Xiao Lian felt a strong sense of guilt and uneasiness.</p> <p>For the first time, she had the idea of &#8203;&#8203;leaving.</p> <p>She didn't want the orphanage to be involved in these things. If the officials came, the orphanage would be in trouble.</p> <p>At this moment, Xiao Lian was full of regret.</p> <p>"Da Da..."&#160;</p> <p>Footsteps were heard in the yard again. Da Ming walked to the corpse with a sack in his hand and clumsily stuffed the corpse into the sack. He twisted one end of the sack a few times and carried it on his shoulder.</p> <p>While Xiao Lian watched feeling dazed, Da Ming walked out with the sack on his back. He took a few steps and suddenly turned around, with a bright light flashing in his eyes.</p> <p>Daming reminded Xiao Lian honestly: "Don't set fire, Dad will be angry."</p> <p>When Xiao Lian met Da Ming's eyes, she felt confused. Looking at that honest face, Xiao Lian felt a little strange.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Walking out of the courtyard, the sun shone on his body, and he felt hot and stuffy. Chen Da Ming's little hands tightly grasped the opening of the sack and looked at the street.</p> <p>There was no one.</p> <p>He laughed twice, put his shoulders to carry the sack and walked to the street.</p> <p>Da Ming knew that he was stupid. He couldn't figure out many things. But it seemed that since last month, things that he couldn't figure out before seemed to be easily understood.</p> <p>Every day he sat in the library, reading the "Water Margin Comic Book", and he understood the stories in it.</p> <p>He learned a lot of things, such as: if you encounter bad people doing bad things, you must stop them; if bad people die, you must put them in a sack and find a place to bury them; some inns are black shops, so be careful; if someone dies, people will be arrested by the government...</p> <p>Da Ming knew that his father was using books to teach him some principles of life.</p> <p>He liked those principles and liked the fighting villains in the book. The days he lived in the orphanage were his happiest times.</p> <p>If the bad guy died at home, the government would take his father away, just like Lin Chong and Yang Zhi, they would be locked up, and his father would be angry.</p> <p>Da Ming didn't want his father to be arrested, and he didn't want his father to be angry.</p> <p>Chen Da Ming walked down the street with his head down, carrying a sack on his shoulder.</p> <p>Although he was only ten years old, his physique was much better than his peers, and his height was close to 1.6 meters. Perhaps in a few years, he would be taller and stronger than an adult.</p> <p>But now, Daming was wondering where he should bury the sack. A slightly warm breeze blew by, carrying a faint scent of osmanthus.</p> <p>Da Ming slowly raised his head, and at the end of the long street, there was a woman in a black dress.</p> <p>He raised his head and smiled at the woman innocently, and continued to walk forward with the sack on his shoulder.</p> <p>Qin Yi stopped and a very faint smell of blood wafted over. She looked at the sack on Chen Da Ming's shoulder.</p> <p>Da Ming seemed to have noticed Qin Yi's gaze, and he raised his head and smiled innocently, his expression normal. He still looked silly, as if Da Ming was carrying the sack just to work.</p> <p>Seeing Da Ming's silly smile, Qin Yi felt a chill in her heart for no reason. Even though the sun was shining brightly overhead, it was still a bit stuffy.</p> <p>This could not dispel the chill in Qin Yi's heart.</p> <p>This child was carrying...</p> <p>a corpse.</p> <p>He was actually smiling at her with a normal expression.</p> <p>Even Qin Yi, who had a lot of blood on her hands, felt a chill in her heart at this moment.</p> <p>Subconsciously, a thought popped up in her mind.</p> <p>This child is a natural killer.</p> <p>Qin Yi didn't have time to think about it. She took a deep breath, used her skills, and stepped into the courtyard of the orphanage in a blink of an eye.</p> <p>She saw her disciple, Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Xiaolian stood in the yard, staring blankly at the direction where Da Ming left, as if she had not yet recovered from the scene just now.</p> <p>Qin Yi was relieved to see that Xiao Lian was safe and sound.</p> <p>"Master." Xiao Lian said softly, her eyes were still in confusion, with deep pain in her eyes.</p> <p>Qin Yi opened her red lips and said calmly, "Are you okay?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian shook her head and said, "I killed him."</p> <p>After that, she took a deep breath, suppressed the emotions that had just surged up, and forced a smile.</p> <p>"Master, who is he? Is he also an assassin from Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Qin Yi did not answer, but looked at the ground, noticing several hidden weapons and bloodstains scattered around.</p> <p>"Where is the body?" Qin Yi asked subconsciously.</p> <p>As soon as she asked, she realized where the body was. Qin Yi turned around and looked back. The figure carrying the sack was almost at the corner of the street.</p> <p>The silly smile on the child's face just now appeared in Qin Yi's mind again. Her body stiffened slightly, and her back felt cold.</p> <p>"I know. Go to the south of the city tonight to find me. I will deal with the body." Qin Yi's calm voice had a little more ups and downs.</p> <p>After that, her figure flashed, her feet lightly stepped on the ground, and she was more than ten feet away. After a few ups and downs, she caught up with Da Ming.</p> <p>Not long after, Da Ming came back, and he still had a silly smile on his face. "I met a kind person."&#160;</p> <p>He laughed twice, walked into the east wing, fetched a basin of water, and returned to the yard. He took out a rag and prepared to wipe the floor carefully.</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked at Da Ming deeply, walked over to put away the hidden weapon, and helped Da Ming clean the floor and wipe off the blood.</p> <p>Neither of them noticed that there was a little head by the window, blinking its big black eyes, curiously looking at the scene in the yard.</p> <p>He didn't expect that Yu Luosha would be hunted down by Fengyu Tower...</p> <p>He really didn't understand what Fengyu Tower was doing.</p> <p>...</p> <p>Chen Ye walked out of the Ju Ke Inn, half squinting his eyes, facing the scorching sun above his head. There were few pedestrians on the street, most of them were staying at home to escape the summer heat.</p> <p>After this month, the weather should gradually get cooler.</p> <p>He returned to the orphanage and saw Da Ming with his upper body naked, supporting the ground with one hand, practicing one-arm handstand push-ups up and down.</p> <p>Sweat beads slid down Da Ming's face and wet the ground under him.</p> <p>"Da Ming, didn't Dad tell you? Wait until it's cooler before you practice. There's no need to rush for exercise. When you're stronger, I'll find someone to put some stone locks on you." Chen Ye walked over, and Da Ming turned over and landed steadily.</p> <p>He smiled innocently, "Dad."</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't help but laugh, and took out a bag of peanuts from his arms: "Here, little brat."</p> <p>Da Ming's eyes lit up, he took the peanuts, opened the oil paper bag, and stuffed them into his mouth happily.</p> <p>Chen Ye patted Da Ming on the shoulder and walked into the room.</p> <p>He saw Xiao Lian sitting on the bed, with needle and thread beside her, she stared out the window, a little absent-minded.</p> <p>"Are you worried about something?" Chen Ye asked casually.</p> <p>Xiao Lian came back to her senses, lowered her eyes, and whispered: "Nothing."</p> <p>At a glance, Chen Ye knew that Xiao Lian was lying. Xiao Lian was not good at lying. Every time she lied, she would subconsciously lower her head and dare not look at Chen Ye.</p> <p>"If you have something on your mind, tell me and see if the dean can help you solve it. Do you want to buy a new dress or some jewelry? The Director has nothing else now, but he still has some money in his pocket." Chen Ye sat casually on the chair with a gentle smile.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin of Wanjin Hall gave him 200 taels of gold notes, which he exchanged for silver notes. There is no need to worry about the living expenses of the orphanage.</p> <p>Chen Ye's voice was as gentle as a spring breeze, which made Xiao Lian's eyes slightly red and she felt guilty.</p> <p>Today, the assassin from Fengyu Tower came to the door and almost implicated the orphanage.</p> <p>This made Xiao Lian very uneasy.</p> <p>She has lived with Chen Ye and Da Ming for two months. Chen Ye is very good to her, and she doesn't want to implicate Chen Ye.</p> <p>After a long time, she opened her mouth and hesitated: "Director, I... I..."</p> <p>"Wow..."</p> <p>Just when Xiao Lian mustered up the courage to say that, Xiaofu on the side suddenly burst into tears.</p> <p>Chen Ye hurriedly stood up, walked over to pick up Xiaofu, and coaxed: "Little ancestor, why are you crying again?"</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye patiently coaxing Xiaofu, the courage that Xiaolian had just mustered up disappeared in an instant.</p> <p>She pursed her lips and said nothing.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Yuhang County.</p> <p>It was late at night and quiet.</p> <p>A petite figure avoided the sight of the night patrol, and with her inner strength filling her feet, she climbed over several courtyard walls in a few leaps and bounds.</p> <p>The guard dog in the courtyard had no time to make a sound before a small stone hit its throat.</p> <p>The dogs made a whining sound, their hair stood up, their tails drooped, and they looked nervously at the figure flying over the eaves and walls.</p> <p>After climbing over the last house, Xiao Lian came to a deserted alley.</p> <p>As soon as she stopped, Qin Yi's voice came from the treetops beside her.</p> <p>"Your Rainy Body Technique is progressing rapidly. In a few days, you will be able to go from Minor Success to Master. By then, you will be a warrior of the Third level."</p> <p>You have too little practical experience. Stay with me, I can protect you and guide you at the same time."</p> <p>Xiao Lian heard this, her eyes drooped, and her smart eyes were a little dim.</p> <p>She bit her lip lightly, and her heart was tangled. She didn't want to leave the orphanage. But if she continued to stay in the orphanage, it would bring trouble to Chen Ye.</p> <p>After speaking, Qin Yi stepped lightly on the ground, displayed her body skills, and disappeared into the night like a startled swan. Xiao Lian looked at Qin Yi's departing figure, with a trace of confusion in her eyes.</p> <p>Chen Ye got out of bed, picked up a white shirt from the chair next to him, and put it on.</p> <p>That was the liveliness of a girl before she matured, and a faint green charm. Xiao Lian's smart eyes dropped slightly, staring at the ground.</p> <p>Xiao Lian met Chen Ye's gentle eyes, subconsciously lowered her head, and dared not look at him again.</p> <p>Xiao Lian sniffed and tried hard not to cry. No one had said such words to her since her mother died.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The drizzle of rain fell from the gray sky, lightly dripping on the broken city walls. Black smoke rose from the city.</p> <p>At the corner of the street. A little girl in tattered clothes sat on the ground, staring at the cavalry with lifeless eyes, holding a moldy steamed bun in her hand.</p> <p>The man suddenly cried out in pain, his finger was bitten by the little girl.</p> <p>Blood flowed down his finger.</p> <p>"Let go! Let go, you little bastard!" The man wailed in pain, and his fists rained down on the little girl.</p> <p>"Ah!"</p> <p>Qin Yi then exhaled a breath of relief.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Chen Ye lifted the lid of the pot, and white steam poured out of the pot.</p> <p>"It's okay, it's not deformed." Chen Ye was relieved when he saw the steamed dumplings.</p> <p>This big pot of dumplings was almost all made by Xiao Lian.</p> <p>"What a waste."</p> <p>The productivity of the Dawu Dynasty was limited, and the people mostly relied on rice and grains as their staple food.</p> <p>On the fourth day, he met Da Ming, and on the fifth day, he met Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Now one of them is leaving. You will also feel melancholy. Not only melancholy, but also worry and reluctance.</p> <p>Chen Ye hurriedly stopped her: "It's almost noon, leave it there."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Xiao Lian left.</p> <p>Chen Ye leaned back on the recliner, holding the Innate Qi Technique in his hand, staring at the clear sky outside the window.</p> <p>Someone suddenly left the house, and he felt lonely all of a sudden. In the future, cooking, washing clothes, and coaxing Xiaofu will all fall on Chen Ye.</p> <p>Of course, there is nothing wrong with doing some work for his own little family. It's just that the orphanage feels deserted all of a sudden.</p> <p>Staring at the sky, Chen Ye closed the Innate Qi Technique a little irritably. He was not in the mood to read it.</p> <p>"Dad, I'm going to chop wood." Daming poked his head in, carrying a bamboo basket on his back, a small axe on his waist, and a silly smile on his face.&#160;</p> <p>"Go, be careful when you go up the mountain, we have enough dry food, and our family is not afraid of you eating."</p> <p>Chen Ye waved his hand casually and said.</p> <p>Compared with Xiao Lian, Daming is the one who makes him feel most at ease.</p> <p>He is honest and simple, simple and ordinary. At a young age, he already has a future wife. When he is old enough, maybe he can even become a grandfather.</p> <p>(Yuyu: You're already thinking of being a grandfather, quite optimistic&#8230;)</p> <p>Just thinking about it, Chen Ye couldn't help laughing.</p> <p>He closed his eyes, tapped the handle of the chair lightly, and hummed a little tune.</p> <p>Daming carried the bamboo basket, walked out of the yard, and quietly closed the door. After closing the door, Daming exhaled, with a silly smile on his face, and looked up at the sky.</p> <p>The sun was shining and the weather was clear. A few faint white clouds were scattered in the blue sky.</p> <p>It shouldn't rain today.</p> <p>Daming came to this conclusion.</p> <p>He didn't like rainy days because it would delay him from cutting trees.</p> <p>Carrying the bamboo basket, Daming trotted along the street with ease.</p> <p>He ran to the door of his cheap father-in-law, Zhang Long.</p> <p>Pushing open the wooden fence door of Zhang Long's house, Daming shouted, "Uncle."</p> <p>"Daming, wait a moment."</p> <p>Zhang Long's voice came from the north room.</p> <p>After a while, Zhang Long came out and saw the increasingly strong Daming, with a satisfied look on his face.</p> <p>"Daming, have you eaten?"</p> <p>"Yes."</p> <p>With Chen Ye's teaching and the addition of the skill "Great Wisdom Appears Foolish", Daming gradually mastered more and more daily expressions.</p> <p>Zhang Long walked into the woodshed built with a wooden shed, picked up the big axe that was shining with cold light, and casually put it on his waist.</p> <p>Daming stared at the big axe with shining eyes.</p> <p>Zhang Long walked over with a smile and patted Daming's head: "Wait for a while. When you have more strength, I'll change a big one for you."</p> <p>Zhang Long looked at Daming with loving eyes. He liked this strong child from the bottom of his heart.</p> <p>Daming didn't say anything, just smiled twice.</p> <p>As usual, the two of them left the city and walked towards the nearby mountains and forests.</p> <p>On the way, Daming and Zhang Long met a few woodcutters like them, all of whom were acquaintances.</p> <p>Several people went up the mountain and started the day's work with laughter.</p> <p>After going up the mountain, Daming found the big tree that Zhang Long and several others had cut down yesterday, and used his small axe to cut off the thick branches.&#160;</p> <p>Then he cut them into the same size.</p> <p>The whole morning passed quickly in the busyness and dirty jokes of the men.</p> <p>The sun was shining brightly, and the woodcutters were shirtless and sweating.</p> <p>Zhang Long put down his axe, picked up the water bag on the ground, weighed it twice, and it was empty.</p> <p>"Daming, bring some water back!" He shouted loudly.</p> <p>Daming stopped chopping wood, wiped the sweat from his face, and responded with a silly smile.</p> <p>He ran over and picked up the water bags of several woodcutters and ran to the nearby river.</p> <p>Along the mountain road, the sound of gurgling water was heard soon.</p> <p>A river flows around the mountain, the water is two meters deep, and fish and shrimps can occasionally be seen swimming in the river on the surface of the water.</p> <p>Daming walked to the river bank on the smooth and wet pebbles, dipped the water bag in the river, and began to fill it with water.</p> <p>The river water flows slowly, and the cool water splashes on the shore, dispelling the stuffiness around.</p> <p>Daming squatted on the river bank and saw several gray-black carps more than ten inches long on the water surface, swinging their tails and wandering freely in the water.&#160;</p> <p>It seemed peaceful and quiet.</p> <p>At this time, Daming saw something floating down from upstream. Daming stood up and saw that it was a large tree trunk with a person lying on it.</p> <p>The man was floating on the river surface, and when he saw Daming on the shore, he hurriedly shouted: "Brother, save me!"</p> <p>Daming looked closely and saw that the other person had a childish face, disheveled hair, and the whole person was soaked in the water, with a pale face.</p> <p>It seems that he has been drifting in the water holding the wood for some time.</p> <p>Daming looked around and saw a long branch scattered on the ground. He walked over to pick up the branch, stood on the shore and stretched the branch into the river.&#160;</p> <p>The river was a bit turbulent.</p> <p>As soon as the branch fell into the water, it was carried by the current.</p> <p>Daming increased the strength of his hand, and the branch lay steadily on the water.</p> <p>The figure holding the wood reached out to reach the branch handed by Daming. His fingertips touched the branch, and the man held it tightly.</p> <p>Seeing that the other party held it firmly, Daming exerted force on his hand and pulled the branch little by little.</p> <p>The boy who fell into the water was brought to the shore. He turned ashore and lay on the shore, gasping for breath.</p> <p>The other party was a child, who looked only eleven or twelve years old. He was wearing a patched linen shirt and was soaked.</p> <p>The child's face was pale, his lips were blue and purple, and the skin on his neck was also whitened by the river water.</p> <p>When the child lay on the shore, gasping for breath, his chest bulged high, and something moved inside.&#160;</p> <p>Daming rescued the child without saying anything. He just smiled twice, picked up the water bag filled with water, and turned to leave.</p> <p>After a while, Sun Sheng recovered some strength and hurriedly sat up from the shore. He shouted: "Thank you for your help!"</p> <p>As soon as he finished speaking, Sun Sheng was stunned and looked around.</p> <p>The man who just saved him was gone.</p> <p>"Benefactor?"</p> <p>"Benefactor?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng shouted a few times, but there was no response.</p> <p>He looked strange and was stunned on the spot.</p> <p>"Pu Leng Leng..."</p> <p>A cold and slippery feeling came from his chest. Sun Sheng only then remembered what was on his chest.</p> <p>He hurriedly lifted up his shirt, and a huge green-backed carp slipped out of his clothes and fell to the ground.&#160;</p> <p>The carp fell to the ground and struggled to flip its body.</p> <p>The slimy fish was soon covered with dirt.</p> <p>Seeing this fish, Sun Sheng was furious. He picked up a stone from the shore and slapped it on the fish's head with a grin.</p> <p>"It's all your fault. I almost drowned in the river."</p> <p>The fish was hit on the head by the stone several times, and it stopped moving and lay straight on the ground.</p> <p>Sun Sheng threw away the stone, took out a rusty broken dagger from his arms, and cut a hole on the fish's chin.&#160;</p> <p>He took a thin branch and pierced the fish's chin and lifted the fish up.</p> <p>After doing this, Sun Sheng hurriedly looked around and muttered softly: "Where is the benefactor?"</p> <p>"No, I have to find the benefactor."</p> <p>"Damn it, the word righteousness comes first when you come out to make a living.&#8221;&#160;</p> <p>"In life, you must repay kindness."</p> <p>Sun Sheng muttered some curse words, looked at the ground a few times, and found clues.</p> <p>There were several puddles of water and several footprints on the dirt road.</p> <p>Sun Sheng picked up the fish and chased in the direction of the footprints.</p> <p>Daming returned to the forest happily with a water bag filled with water in his hand.</p> <p>Before he got there, he heard the woodcutters talking dirty again.</p> <p>"Old Liu, I see your legs are weak. Did you work too hard last night?"</p> <p>"Get out! Do you think I'm like you, who doesn't want to get out of bed after getting into bed?"</p> <p>"Haha!" The woodcutters laughed.</p> <p>Mechanical physical work is boring, and they always need to have some fun while working.</p> <p>"Daming is back!" one of them shouted.</p> <p>Zhang Long saw Daming coming back with a water bag, and a smile appeared on his face.</p> <p>Several people took their own water bags and drank from them in big gulps.</p> <p>Daming sat on a wooden stake and also drank from the water like other woodcutters.</p> <p>"The fish that boy is carrying is quite fat."</p> <p>Suddenly, a woodcutter looked not far away and remarked.&#160;</p> <p>The others looked over.</p> <p>In the woods a few dozen meters away, there was a boy in linen clothes holding a carp covered with mud in his hand, looking left and right.</p> <p>The boy seemed to see the woodcutters, and his face showed joy. He quickened his pace and ran straight towards them.</p> <p>Sun Sheng trotted all the way to Daming, and casually put the carp in his hand on the ground.</p> <p>He bowed and said, "Thank you for your help!"</p> <p>This sudden scene stunned everyone present.</p> <p>Daming didn't say anything, he looked at Sun Sheng with a silly smile on his face.</p> <p>Among the woodcutters, a man with a sharp face and a shrewd look noticed Sun Sheng's wet clothes and smiled, "Great! Daming saved someone quietly."</p> <p>Others saw Sun Sheng's wet clothes and thought of Daming fetching water just now, and they all praised him.</p> <p>"Daming is a kind-hearted child."</p> <p>"It's Mr. Chen who taught him well!"</p> <p>"I wish my kid could be half as sensible as Daming."</p> <p>The woodcutters praised Daming, and Zhang Long couldn't help but smile.</p> <p>Nothing makes people happier than hearing others praise their future son-in-law.</p> <p>Daming still had a silly smile on his face and kept silent.</p> <p>Seeing that Daming had been silent, Sun Sheng looked up at Daming. Daming looked ordinary, and his temperament was simple and honest.</p> <p>Seeing that Daming was unmoved, Sun Sheng shouted loudly: "My benefactor, I can never repay you for saving my life. I am willing to swear brotherhood with you, my benefactor, and regard you as my elder brother!"</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Hearing the childish voice in front of them, the woodcutters present all laughed.</p> <p>"Boy, how old are you this year?" asked the sharp-nosed woodcutter.</p> <p>Sun Sheng raised his head and asked in confusion, "12 years old, what's wrong?"</p> <p>The woodcutters laughed even louder.</p> <p>Zhang Long had a smile on his face and joked, "Da Ming is only 10 years old this year."</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng's face suddenly turned red.</p> <p>Da Ming's height and physique far exceeded his peers, and he didn't look like he was 10 years old.</p> <p>He was obviously older than Da Ming, but he regarded him as his elder brother...</p> <p>Sun Sheng looked at Da Ming with a simple face, gritted his teeth and said, "I can't repay you for saving my life."</p> <p>"You have to be loyal when you get out there!"</p> <p>"Big brother!"</p> <p>After saying that, Sun Sheng stood up and imitated the people in the Jianghu to clasp his fists and bow.</p> <p>The woodcutters were completely amused by Sun Sheng.</p> <p>"Kid, go back to where you came from."</p> <p>"We are just a group of woodcutters, not Jianghu people."</p> <p>"Yes, kid, go home, your parents must be waiting anxiously."</p> <p>The woodcutters advised.</p> <p>Sun Sheng's eyes turned red, and he said, "My parents are dead, and I am the only one at home now."</p> <p>Hearing this, the woodcutters were silent.</p> <p>It turned out to be an orphan.</p> <p>Zhang Long touched his rough beard, pondered for a while, and suddenly his eyes lit up.</p> <p>"Boy, if you really want to worship Da Ming as your big brother, I will teach you a trick."</p> <p>Zhang Long turned around and pointed at the wood that Da Ming had chopped in the morning, and said, "Tie these branches with ropes."</p> <p>"After you're done, I'll tell you about a good place."</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>"Tap tap..."</p> <p>A carriage was driving on the official road.</p> <p>"Girl, Lin'an County is ahead. There is a teahouse on the official road. Do you want to get out of the car for some tea?"</p> <p>The driver said while driving.</p> <p>In the carriage, Qin Yi opened her eyes and calmed the internal force circulating in her body.</p> <p>She looked at Xiao Lian and asked, "Do you want to get off?"</p> <p>The two left Yuhang County and hired a carriage. They have been traveling for a whole morning. It should be time for lunch.</p> <p>Xiao Lian hummed and said, "I'm fine with anything."</p> <p>She had a wooden lunch box at hand, and her lively eyes were staring out of the carriage.</p> <p>Qin Yi was puzzled.</p> <p>Her disciple seemed to be worried.</p> <p>"After the matter of Fengyu Tower is clarified, you can go back." Qin Yi said calmly.</p> <p>"Yeah." Xiao Lian had a faint smile on her pretty face, and there was a light in her eyes.</p> <p>It seemed that she was looking forward to returning to Yuhang County.</p> <p>"Stop at the teahouse in front." Qin Yi said to the driver.</p> <p>Not long after, the carriage slowly stopped. Qin Yi and Xiao Lian got off the carriage and came to the teahouse on the official road.</p> <p>At this time, the sun was shining, and there were no customers in the teahouse.</p> <p>The tea master in the teahouse held a fan in his hand, and fanned from time to time to dispel the stuffiness in the air.</p> <p>"Bring a pot of tea and some snacks." Qin Yi said lightly.</p> <p>The tea master responded, put down the fan, and went into the back kitchen.</p> <p>This place is close to Lin'an Prefecture. The roadside teahouses are slightly larger and will prepare some snacks for passers-by to fill their stomachs.</p> <p>"Snacks don't fill your stomach. Isn't there a food box? Let me see what's in it?" A frivolous and lazy voice came from the side.</p> <p>Xiao Lian felt her left hand lighten.</p> <p>A man in a jute shirt and holding a blade of grass in his mouth appeared beside her.</p> <p>He had a black-sheathed black knife on his waist and a wooden food box in his left hand.</p> <p>The food box somehow got into his hands.</p> <p>"Give it back to me." Xiao Lian's pretty face changed slightly, and a cold flash flashed in her eyes.</p> <p>The man ignored Xiao Lian. He opened the food box on his own and saw what was inside. He exclaimed: "Wow! White flour dumplings! It's not even the Mid-Autumn Festival yet..."</p> <p>Before the man finished speaking, he turned in the air and avoided several cold rays that attacked him.</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips slightly, her eyes were cold, and she fired hidden weapons with both hands.</p> <p>More than ten kinds of Tang Sect hidden weapons fell on the man like raindrops.</p> <p>"Wow..."</p> <p>A sound like waves came out.</p> <p>Then, a few knife lights blocked the cold rays that came head-on like a barrier.</p> <p>A large number of hidden weapons were scattered on the ground.</p> <p>"Stop, stop, stop."</p> <p>The man held the food box in his left hand and the black-handled long knife in his right hand. The grass leaf in his mouth fell to the ground at some point.</p> <p>The blade of the long knife was as black as ink, and it looked deep and cold under the sunlight.</p> <p>The man looked helpless and blocked the food box in front of him. If Xiao Lian continued to attack, the hidden weapon would hit the food box.</p> <p>Seeing this, Xiao Lian's eyes were still cold, but the hand that fired the hidden weapon stopped.</p> <p>Seeing Xiao Lian stop, the man breathed a sigh of relief, and looked at Xiao Lian with a hint of surprise.</p> <p>"Qin Yi, is this the disciple you accepted?"</p> <p>"This Tang Sect technique, if you hadn't told me, I would have thought it was some little genius from the Tang Sect."</p> <p>Huang San sheathed the black knife again and handed the food box back to Xiao Lian with a helpless look.&#160;</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips slightly, took the food box back, and looked at Huang San with a vigilant look.</p> <p>Huang San noticed her eyes and the corners of his mouth twitched twice.</p> <p>He felt a little guilty, as if he was snatching a child's candied haws.</p> <p>Qin Yi glanced at Huang San calmly, sat on the bench, and said in a calm tone: "What are you doing here?"</p> <p>Huang San did not speak. He first looked around on the ground, then ran straight to the bushes, plucked a blade of grass and held it in his mouth, and then said: "Hey, look at what you said. We are now grasshoppers on the same rope."</p> <p>Hearing this, Qin Yi's delicate eyebrows frowned slightly. "Did you kill him?"</p> <p>Huang San shook his head: "No one gave me money, why should I kill him?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian put the food box on the wooden table with a lunch box in her hand and glanced at Huang San.</p> <p>Huang San changed the subject and smiled: "But I stole a token."</p> <p>He took out a golden token from his arms, on which was engraved a pattern of wind and rain.</p> <p>Qin Yi's eyes were more turbulent. "What do you want?"</p> <p>Huang San smiled and put away the token: "It's a pleasure to talk to you."</p> <p>"I want to go to see the owner of the building with you, no&#8230; To be precise, we are going to see the owner of the building together."</p> <p>Qin Yi lowered his eyes, as if he heard something, and said in a flat voice: "You are different from me."</p> <p>"What's the difference?"</p> <p>A strong and sturdy voice came.</p> <p>Xiao Lian subconsciously looked in the direction of the voice.</p> <p>She saw a two-meter-tall and door-wide, strong man squeezed out of the back kitchen of the teahouse.</p> <p>The strong man had a wolf head tattoo on his face and two purple gold hammers on his back. His expression was fierce enough to scare children to tears.</p> <p>"Little girl, what's your name? You used the hidden weapon well just now, but the hits were too scattered. You have to aim at the acupuncture points..."</p> <p>A hoarse voice came from behind Xiao Lian.</p> <p>She turned around in a hurry and saw an old woman with a hunched body and gray hair behind her.</p> <p>The old woman was holding a basket in her hand, and Xiao Lian vaguely heard a slight hissing sound in the basket.</p> <p>The old woman appeared behind Xiao Lian at some point.</p> <p>Hearing the hissing sound in the basket, Xiao Lian subconsciously took a few steps back.</p> <p>"Why are you trying to scare the youngsters? Be careful, Qin Yiyi will chop your beloved ones in two."</p> <p>A weak scholar in white clothes and holding a fan suddenly jumped down from the ceiling of the teahouse.</p> <p>He smiled gently at Xiao Lian and said, "Miss, I am honored to meet you."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Suddenly, three more people appeared. Qin Yi looked at Huang San without changing his expression.</p> <p>"You four also want to be on the wanted list of Fengyu Tower?"</p> <p>Huang San sat opposite Qin Yi, put the golden token on the wooden table, and smiled faintly: "Qin Yi, it seems that you are the only one who doesn't know now."</p> <p>The other three looked at Qin Yi at the same time with complicated eyes.</p> <p>Qin Yi read disdain, jealousy, and sadness from the eyes of the three people.</p> <p>It is hard to imagine what could make the three gold medal killers of Fengyu Tower look at her with such complicated eyes.</p> <p>"What is it?" Qin Yi's tone was still calm, but there was a wave in her autumn-water eyes.</p> <p>"Huang San, tell her quickly, and let's go together after that."</p> <p>The burly man with two purple gold hammers on his back said loudly.</p> <p>The weak scholar in white clothes and holding a fan seemed to be dissatisfied with the simple idea of &#8203;&#8203;the burly man, and said: "Chen Er, why are you so anxious? You can't eat hot tofu in a hurry."</p> <p>The burly man glanced at the scholar: "If it's any later, Fengyu Tower might be destroyed."</p> <p>"You two quarrel every time you meet, aren't you annoyed?" The old woman with a basket on her arm said impatiently.</p> <p>Xiao Lian noticed that her voice suddenly changed from hoarse to crisp like a girl.</p> <p>The voice was completely inconsistent with her appearance.</p> <p>Qin Yi glanced at the three people opposite her and asked, "What's the matter?"</p> <p>Huang San smiled and looked at Qin Yi with compassion.</p> <p>"Except for the gold medal killers in Lin'an Prefecture and Shaoxing Prefecture, all the other gold medals in the Dawu Dynasty have been transferred back to the Tower by the Tower Master." Huang San said, pointing to the sky.</p> <p>"You are the only disciple of the Tower Master. Why didn't he transfer the killers from Lin'an Prefecture and Shaoxing Prefecture?"</p> <p>Qin Yi's pupils shrank slightly, and she suddenly realized something.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Sun Sheng tied the rope on the branch with great effort, and the rough hemp rope rubbed his palm. He had been soaking in the water for most of the day, and there was nothing in his stomach except water.</p> <p>Now, according to Zhang Long's instructions, he tied all the chopped branches together. Sun Sheng was already hungry, and his hands and feet were weak. It took him a long time to tie up the firewood scattered on the ground.</p> <p>"Uncle, I'm done." Sun Sheng ran to Zhang Long who was waving an axe.</p> <p>Zhang Long stopped panting, wiped the sweat from his face, and walked to the bundled branches.</p> <p>After checking, Zhang Long nodded with satisfaction and said, "You will follow Da Ming later."</p> <p>"Whether you can stay or not depends on you."</p> <p>Zhang Long patted Sun Sheng on the shoulder, returned to the logging team, and continued to swing the axe.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was stunned for a few seconds and scratched his head. He felt a burning pain as soon as his palm touched his hair. He quickly took his hand off with a grin, and sat aside waiting for the few people to finish their work.</p> <p>It didn't take long for the woodcutters in the woods to finish cutting today's firewood, each carrying firewood and going down the mountain together.</p> <p>Sun Sheng followed Da Ming, holding a carp covered with mud in his hand, which was unrecognizable. After they entered the city, Da Ming and Zhang Long separated and took Sun Sheng to another direction.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was confused. He originally thought that the good brother he recognized was Zhang Long's son, but now it seems that he is not.</p> <p>Walking along the bluestone road, moving forward all the way.</p> <p>A faint scent of powder floated in the air. Several gentle female voices came from above.</p> <p>Sun Sheng followed Da Ming and opened his eyes wide when he saw the building in front and the women dressed up in fancy clothes on the upper floors.</p> <p>"Gulp..."</p> <p>Sun Sheng looked at those women and swallowed subconsciously.</p> <p>Hearing the voice, Da Ming turned around and smiled at him: "Let's go there when I have money."</p> <p>Sun Sheng was stunned for a moment, staring at Da Ming in a daze, and it was hard to imagine that these words came out of the mouth of the silly big brother.</p> <p>After Da Ming finished speaking, he continued to walk with his head down. Sun Sheng's eyes were always glancing at those women.</p> <p>Although he was still a virgin, he often heard the brothers in the gang talk about women. They said that women are made of water. The waves raised by women are bigger than those raised on the sea. Only real men can survive the waves raised by women.</p> <p>Sun Sheng recalled the dirty words said by the brothers in the gang in his mind, his face turned red, and he couldn't help but bend down slightly, not daring to look at the girls in Yihong Brothel again.</p> <p>Turning the corner, a plaque with five large characters "Yuhang Orphanage" appeared in front of Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Da Ming took Sun Sheng straight to the door of the orphanage.</p> <p>Sun Sheng stood outside the door, staring at the plaque in a trance. After taking a look, he felt that the last character looked familiar, as if he had seen it somewhere.</p> <p>Hui Chun Tang? Or Bai Cao Tang?</p> <p>Sun Sheng pondered the words on the plaque, thinking in his mind, but the number didn't match.</p> <p>The medical clinics he had seen before all had three words on them, why did this one have five words?</p> <p>After a long time, he came to his senses and asked, "Brother, does your family run a medical clinic?"</p> <p>This question also stumped Da Ming. Da Ming thought for a moment and said nothing.&#160;</p> <p>Sun Sheng followed Da Ming into the courtyard with the carp in his hand.</p> <p>"Dad!" Da Ming shouted as soon as he entered the yard.</p> <p>"I heard you, why are you shouting so loudly?"</p> <p>Chen Ye's lazy voice came from the house.</p> <p>Chen Ye stood up from the recliner and walked out of the house.</p> <p>"Huh? Who is this?" Chen Ye asked subconsciously when he saw a little boy with disheveled hair and a fish in his hand following Da Ming.</p> <p>Da Ming turned his head and looked at Sun Sheng innocently.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was stunned for a moment, then he reacted and ran to Chen Ye, put the fish aside, and bowed his head: "Uncle, my name is Sun Sheng, and I am the sworn brother of Brother Da Ming."</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Sun Sheng's standard bowing movements, and fell into silence.</p> <p>After a while, Chen Ye found out what happened from Sun Sheng.</p> <p>He looked at Sun Sheng with a strange expression and asked, "Are you an orphan?"</p> <p>"Yeah!" Sun Sheng's eyes were slightly red, and he was a little depressed. It seemed to have brought back an experience he didn't want to recall.</p> <p>Chen Ye touched his chin and looked at the thin and pale boy in front of him. Sun Sheng clasped his hands together, imitating the etiquette of the people in the Jianghu, with a respectful face.</p> <p>This child looks quite smart, but his body looks too weak. He was as thin as a bamboo pole.</p> <p>Chen Ye thought for a moment and said, "If you have nowhere to go, you can live with me. You can do some work and learn something. You will have something to eat."</p> <p>Sun Sheng was overjoyed when he heard this, and bowed his head and said, "Thank you, uncle. I have liked acupuncture and stone therapy since I was a child, but I have no way to learn medicine. I have a heart to save the world, but I have no place to use it!"</p> <p>Sun Sheng's tone was mixed with sadness and joy, as if his lifelong wish could finally come true.</p> <p>Chen Ye was stunned when he heard this, and he couldn't understand what this had to do with him for a long time. Suddenly, Chen Ye realized something.</p> <p>He pulled Sun Sheng out of the orphanage, pointed to the five big characters on the plaque and asked, "How do you read these characters?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng was shocked when he heard this, and cold sweat broke out on his back. It's bad, he knew that the clinic always wanted apprentices who could read. He couldn't read, would he be kicked out?</p> <p>When he thought of this, Sun Sheng's blood boiled in his heart, and he bowed his head in a standard way.</p> <p>"Uncle, I only recognize the last word 'tang', I think it's the name of our clinic."</p> <p>Chen Ye didn't know whether to laugh or cry after hearing this.</p> <p>Oh, here comes another illiterate person.</p> <p>"This is not a clinic, it's an orphanage." Chen Ye explained with a smile.</p> <p>Hearing the three words 'orphanage', Sun Sheng was stunned and embarrassed.</p> <p>"Well, actually, I have always admired the good deeds of the orphanage..."

Director will cook for you.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Fortunately, Xiao Sheng brought a fish. Let&#8217;s clean it up; it should taste great steamed.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Da Ming, take Xiao Sheng to the river for a bath first. Afterward, he can change into clean clothes.&#8221;</p> <p>With these instructions, Chen Ye headed into the kitchen and got busy.</p> <p>Before long, the rice was steaming, and the sound of small footsteps came from the courtyard.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming returned, leading a freshly cleaned Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at the now-clean Sun Sheng, momentarily stunned. He rubbed his eyes, looking surprised.</p> <p>&#8220;Well, you clean up pretty well, kid... almost as handsome as me.&#8221;</p> <p>Gone was the disheveled boy from earlier.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was now dressed in Da Ming&#8217;s old yellow hemp short shirt. His messy hair was tied back, revealing a bright and youthful face.</p> <p>Though the clothes hung a bit loose on him, standing in the courtyard, he looked like a young tree swaying gracefully in the breeze.</p> <p>Of course, he was still a bit behind Chen Ye.</p> <p>Sun Sheng scratched his head sheepishly.</p> <p>&#8220;Grrrr&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>His stomach growled again.</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled. &#8220;Hold on; the food&#8217;s almost ready.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Da Ming, help me bring out the dishes,&#8221; Chen Ye said.</p> <p>&#8220;Director, let me do it.&#8221; Sun Sheng eagerly stepped into the kitchen. Upon seeing the dishes laid out on the table, he couldn&#8217;t help but gulp.</p> <p>A plate of steamed fish, a roast chicken, and two stir-fried vegetable dishes. The rich aroma of the food filled the kitchen, and the dishes looked enticing. The glistening oil and fragrant smells made Sun Sheng&#8217;s mouth water.</p> <p>Resisting the temptation, he carried the dishes out of the kitchen.</p> <p>Before long, the meal was ready. The dining table at the orphanage was once again set for three.</p> <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat,&#8221; Chen Ye announced.</p> <p>Da Ming wasted no time tearing off a drumstick and handing it to Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled and placed it back on Da Ming&#8217;s plate. &#8220;You&#8217;re still growing; you eat it.&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming grinned sheepishly and eagerly bit into the drumstick, his mouth soon glistening with oil.</p> <p>Chen Ye tore off the other drumstick and placed it in Sun Sheng&#8217;s bowl. &#8220;Xiao Sheng, you eat too.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;ve come to our orphanage, we&#8217;re family now,&#8221; Chen Ye said gently, picking up some vegetables with his chopsticks.</p> <p>Sun Sheng stared at the drumstick in his bowl, his eyes gradually turning red.</p> <p>He sniffled and, despite his growling stomach, didn&#8217;t touch the food right away.</p> <p>Instead, he stood up from his chair, knelt down, and bowed deeply, his expression serious and respectful. &#8220;I&#8217;ve drifted through life with no one to guide me. Now that I&#8217;ve met you, Director, I wish to recognize you as my Foster father!&#8221;</p> <p>With that, Sun Sheng kowtowed three times, the sound crisp and loud.</p> <p>Chen Ye quickly set down his chopsticks and helped him up, smiling warmly. &#8220;Where did you learn such things? We don&#8217;t stand on such ceremonies here. Get up. It&#8217;s the thought that counts.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng nodded firmly, his eyes still moist.</p> <p>&#8220;Eat,&#8221; Chen Ye said, patting him on the shoulder.</p> <p>The three of them started eating.</p> <p>The meal didn&#8217;t last long.</p> <p>One Sun Sheng and one Da Ming&#8212;both devoured the food as if they hadn&#8217;t eaten in days. The dishes and rice on the table were swept clean.</p> <p>While eating, Sun Sheng&#8217;s eyes remained red, and his expression lacked the sharpness he had when Chen Ye first met him.</p> <p>This put Chen Ye at ease. The new kid seemed decent.</p> <p>After the meal, Sun Sheng took the initiative to clear the plates and wash them.</p> <p>&#8220;Foster Father, you should rest. I&#8217;ll handle this!&#8221;</p> <p>Though he was so full he could barely move, Sun Sheng insisted on working.</p> <p>This made Chen Ye even more satisfied.</p> <p>Sitting in his chair, Chen Ye summoned the system&#8217;s interface.</p> <p>It was time to claim the reward for his recent mission.</p> <p>With 1,000 points credited, his balance now totaled 3,682 points.</p> <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see what trait I can draw this time,&#8221; Chen Ye thought, opening the orphan skill draw interface.</p> <p>[Consume 1 orphan skill draw opportunity]</p> <p>[Drawing begins...]</p> <p>A translucent blue wheel of fortune appeared before Chen Ye.</p> <p>A few seconds later, the wheel stopped.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! You have drawn the orphan trait: Water Spirit.]</p> <p>[Water Spirit: Greatly enhanced swimming ability and underwater combat effectiveness; however, it induces a longing for rivers and oceans.]</p> <p>Seeing the trait, Chen Ye stroked his chin.</p> <p>&#8220;This trait is rather odd, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Whatever, since Xiao Sheng has joined the orphanage, he&#8217;ll be treated equally.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;He should have a skill too.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye assigned the Water Spirit skill to Sun Sheng.</p> <p>&#8220;Viewed from another angle, this trait isn&#8217;t bad. It&#8217;s perfect for a fisherman!&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled, rubbing his chin with satisfaction.</p> <p>In the kitchen, Sun Sheng, washing dishes, shivered suddenly and instinctively looked toward the river outside Yuhang County.</p> <p>A strange sensation welled up inside him, almost as if&#8230;</p> <p>He wanted to jump into the river and swim.</p> <p>Shaking off the odd feeling, Sun Sheng continued washing dishes.</p> <p>&#8220;Now, let&#8217;s see what special building I can draw,&#8221; Chen Ye mused, using a special building draw opportunity.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! You have obtained the special building: Star-Gazing Room.]</p> <p>[Star-Gazing Room: Allows daily divination for the orphans at the orphanage, providing guidance on good and bad omens (the future can be altered).]</p> <p>Please designate a location for the special building.</p> <p>&#8220;Star-gazing and divination? Not bad.&#8221;</p> <p>A floor plan of the orphanage appeared before Chen Ye.</p> <p>The west wing had already been converted into a study, leaving few room options.</p> <p>After some thought, Chen Ye placed the Star-Gazing Room in his own bedroom.</p> <p>This way, he could perform divination first thing every morning.</p> <p>&#8220;Good. With Xiao Lian traveling, I can keep an eye on her fate.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed softly, an image of Xiao Lian in a green dress, her dimples showing in a gentle smile, surfacing in his mind.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>&#8220;Qin Yi, Tower Master truly treats you well&#8230;&#8221; Huang San remarked with a tone filled with envy.</p> <p>Qin Yi&#8217;s turbulent gaze gradually settled into calm.</p> <p>&#8220;The Shenji Sect wants to annihilate the entire Fengyu Tower with a single order. Both the Wan Jin Hall and Tang Sect have already sent experts there.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The Tower Master summoning assassins from other prefectures makes his intentions clear,&#8221; a frail scholar holding a paper fan sighed. He opened and closed the fan repeatedly, his anxiety evident.</p> <p>&#8220;Hmph! A direct disciple, all because of you&#8212;we didn&#8217;t even know about this until now,&#8221; Chen Er, with two purple-gold hammers strapped to his back, grumbled in a deep voice.</p> <p>His gaze at Qin Yi was filled with disdain.</p> <p>Chen Er despised connections-based disciples like Qin Yi.</p> <p>Qin Yi remained silent, his eyes unreadable.</p> <p>&#8220;When did the Tower Master recall the other assassins?&#8221; Qin Yi asked Huang San.</p> <p>&#8220;On the fourth day of the seventh month&#8212;same day as Qing Xuzi&#8217;s disciple selection,&#8221; Huang San said lazily, a blade of grass shifting between his lips.</p> <p>&#8220;That day, assassins from every region except Shaoxing and Lin&#8217;an started heading back to the Tower.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s the eighth. Four days have passed. If we move now, it&#8217;s not too late. The assassins in the Northeast and Northwest can&#8217;t return in time.&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San stroked the black sheath of his blade and glanced at Qin Yi. &#8220;So? Are you coming with us to the Tower?&#8221;</p> <p>Nearby, an elderly woman carrying a basket spoke up, her hunched frame adding to her ominous tone.</p> <p>&#8220;If you go, you might die.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I heard Wan Jin Hall and Tang Sect have sent many experts this time, including hall masters and direct disciples.&#8221;</p> <p>TL Notes:</p> <p>Steamed fish</p> <p>Roast Chicken</p> <p>Stir-fried Vegetables</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Qin Yi stood up with a sword, speaking in a calm voice: "From Lin'an to Jiangxia, with a fast horse and whip, it will take nine days to arrive."</p> <p>She glanced at the four gold medal assassins with a faint expression.</p> <p>"Compared to me, you should focus on your own safety."</p> <p>Huang San squinted, a smile curving at the corners of his mouth.</p> <p>"Hmph, I said she would definitely go."</p> <p>Chen Er shot a sideways glance at the frail scholar, as if saying, "I told you so."</p> <p>The frail scholar, with a pale face, smiled without responding to Chen Er's provocation, muttering to himself, "This is very good, very good."</p> <p>Qin Yi looked at Xiao Lian and softly said, "You don't need to leave with me, you can stay."</p> <p>"The Gold medal assassins of Shaoxing and Lin'an are all here. After we leave, the silver medal assassins at the third rank won't be able to do anything to you."</p> <p>Xiao Lian closed her eyes, the figures of two men appearing in her mind.</p> <p>After a moment of hesitation, she took a deep breath as if making a decision.</p> <p>Xiao Lian opened her eyes, a determined light flashing in her agile eyes: "I lack experience in combat. I want to go with you."</p> <p>"Hahahaha! Good, with spirit! In the future, if anyone dares to make things difficult for you at Fengyu Tower, just report my name, Chen Er!"</p> <p>A strong man, with a wolf-head tattoo on his face, laughed loudly, his voice booming. He instinctively reached out his large hand to pat Xiao Lian's shoulder.</p> <p>Xiao Lian frowned slightly, shifting her stance and dodging the strong man's hand.</p> <p>The woman, disguised as an old lady, looked at Xiao Lian with interest and spoke in a soft, enchanting voice: "Little girl, I&#8217;m Qian Qi, what&#8217;s your name?"</p> <p>Xiao Lian glanced at her and, after a moment of silence, replied, "Chen Lian."</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Ezhou, Jiangxia County.</p> <p>A light drizzle fell from the sky, landing in the lush bamboo forest.</p> <p>Bamboo leaves held the full raindrops, their tips trembling as pea-sized drops fell to the ground.</p> <p>A graceful bamboo tower stood on a small hill.</p> <p>On the second floor of the bamboo tower, a middle-aged man in a black silk long robe, with golden embroidery on the cuffs, sat cross-legged on a cushion. In front of him was a small tea table.</p> <p>On the tea table was a purple clay teapot the size of a fist and two cups of tea filled to seven-tenths.</p> <p>Outside the bamboo tower, the sound of rain could be heard, soft and rustling.</p> <p>The rain on the bamboo leaves added a touch of tranquility to the small tower.</p> <p>Inside the bamboo tower, the faint fragrance of tea drifted in the air, refreshing the mind.</p> <p>"Lord Wang, would you not sit down and have a cup? This is Longjing tea from before the rain." The middle-aged man in black had a dignified face, and his tone carried a scholarly elegance.</p> <p>Across from him, an old man in a purple round-neck robe stood. His face was pale, without a beard, and his appearance gave off a feminine air.</p> <p>At this moment, he was gazing at the distant green mountains, listening to the soft sound of rain on the bamboo leaves.</p> <p>"We shall not drink. We cannot afford Lord Su's tea." When the old man spoke, his voice was sharp, neither masculine nor feminine, sounding uncomfortable.</p> <p>The middle-aged man in black smiled faintly and said, "There is no Lord Su here."</p> <p>"In front of Lord Wang, there is only the Master of Fengyu Tower." As he spoke, the middle-aged man&#8217;s voice carried a hint of mockery.</p> <p>Lord Wang didn&#8217;t speak. He gazed at the distant mountains, his mood seemingly good.</p> <p>After a while, he said faintly, "Lord Su, when will the second-rank assassins from Fengyu Tower return? Our time is limited."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower smiled lightly, picked up his teacup, blew lightly over the clear, green water, and then took a small sip.</p> <p>"There are thirty-two second-rank assassins in Fengyu Tower. Eight of them have died in the past few days. There are still twenty-four left, spread across the Great Wu Dynasty. The assassins from the East, Northwest, and Southwest will take at least thirteen or fourteen days to arrive."</p> <p>"Since I promised the Emperor, I will keep my word. Please be patient, Lord Wang."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower set the teacup down, slightly closed his eyes, and moved his throat as he savored the pre-rain Longjing tea.</p> <p>"Besides Fengyu Tower, His Majesty has requested something else from Lord Su."</p> <p>Lord Wang turned around, his murky eyes fixed with a deep gaze on the Master of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower slowly opened his eyes, as if he had expected Lord Wang to say those words.</p> <p>He looked toward the green mountains behind Lord Wang and spoke lightly: "Fengyu Tower's intelligence network is unmatched in the world. With control over it, one can hear the winds and rains of the Jianghu, knowing everything."</p> <p>"But I wonder, is the emperor you speak of is my elder brother or the Crown Prince?"</p> <p>Upon hearing these words, Lord Wang instinctively shuddered.</p> <p>He then angrily said, "Lord Su, the ruler of the world is naturally the emperor."</p> <p>"If others were to hear this..."</p> <p>At this point, Lord Wang suddenly fell silent.</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower remained calm and replied: "What if others hear it?"</p> <p>"18 years ago, after my imperial brother seized the throne, he had all my wives and daughters killed. Now, he wants to eliminate Fengyu Tower&#8212;what else is there left for me to hold on to?"</p> <p>As he spoke, the Master of Fengyu Tower suddenly smiled: "My imperial brother, despite being in the court, still has the energy to care about the Jianghu."</p> <p>Lord Wang snorted coldly from the side: "Under the heavens, there is no land that isn't the emperor's."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower didn't argue. He just smiled and said, "The emperor's plans are beyond my comprehension."</p> <p>After saying this, a fleeting trace of loneliness and hatred passed through the Master of Fengyu Tower's eyes.</p> <p>Back then, he had simply made one wrong move&#8230;</p> <p>"Once Fengyu Tower is destroyed, I will let the twelve Earthly Branches return with you, Lord Wang." The Master of Fengyu Tower picked up the purple clay teapot and filled the teacup.</p> <p>The clear, green tea steamed with a white vapor.</p> <p>"However, all of this depends on whether Lord Wang can handle the remaining twenty-four second-rank masters."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower's tone shifted, becoming more indifferent.</p> <p>Lord Wang was about to speak when his face suddenly turned pale. He hastily took out a white handkerchief from his sleeve and covered his mouth, coughing violently.</p> <p>"Cough cough..."</p> <p>Lord Wang's body bent like a large shrimp, his face reddening as if he was about to cough up his insides.</p> <p>After a moment, Lord Wang's pale face gradually improved, turning from white to red.</p> <p>He closed the right hand that had been holding the handkerchief.</p> <p>It was faintly visible that the white handkerchief had small spots of blood on it, like plum blossoms scattered across the snow.</p> <p>Lord Wang gasped a few times, his voice muffled: "There's no need to trouble Lord Su."</p> <p>"The Wanjin Hall and Tang Sect have long wanted to destroy Fengyu Tower. They have enough manpower to satisfy Lord Su."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower nodded faintly: "That&#8217;s good."</p> <p>"Since my imperial brother wants to clear the path for the Crown Prince, he must move swiftly. Those who should be killed, must be killed. Those who should be removed, must be removed."</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower&#8217;s tone carried a touch of sarcasm: "It&#8217;s best to treat everyone equally."</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Lord Wang furrowed his brows, displeasure flashing across his face.</p> <p>But he remained silent.</p> <p>The bamboo tower fell into silence.</p> <p>The light rain outside the window gradually intensified, and only the soft sound of rain on the bamboo leaves remained near the tranquil mountain.</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower slowly closed his eyes, listening to the rain.</p> <p>TL Notes:</p> <p>Longjing Tea: (Chinese: &#40845;&#20117;&#33590;; pinyin: l&#243;ngj&#464;ng ch&#225;), sometimes called by its literal translated name Dragon Well tea, is a variety of pan-roasted green tea from the area of Longjing Village in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

It feels so unique!" Chen Ye muttered to himself.</p> <p>He jumped off the bed and began performing a few basic stances, throwing a few punches with exaggerated flair.</p> <p>The wind from his punches was sharp, and it looked fairly impressive.</p> <p>Chen Ye manipulated the faint internal energy in his body, following the meridians and allowing it to flow through his limbs and torso.</p> <p>He could clearly feel that the parts of his body strengthened by the internal energy had become much more powerful.</p> <p>"Internal energy is truly amazing."</p> <p>Chen Ye controlled the internal energy and returned it to his dantian, feeling invigorated and full of energy.</p> <p>After his excitement settled, Chen Ye furrowed his brows and sighed softly.</p> <p>"I really don&#8217;t have the talent for cultivating internal energy."</p> <p>"Condensing the first trace of internal energy is a milestone, and it took me over ten days."</p> <p>"According to the method, ten traces of internal energy make one at the fourth rank, 100 traces at the third rank, 1,000 at the second rank, and 10,000 at the first rank."</p> <p>"100,000 traces makes one a Grandmaster."</p> <p>"Not to mention reaching the first rank, even reaching the second rank will take thousands of days."</p> <p>"Realistically, it would take thirty or forty years to make any progress. And that&#8217;s not even considering the fact that the method emphasizes solid foundation."</p> <p>"Each breakthrough requires consolidating internal energy and repeatedly compressing and refining it."</p> <p>Calculating the time needed in his mind, Chen Ye couldn't help but smile bitterly.</p> <p>Good news: Internal energy has been cultivated.</p> <p>Bad news: I don&#8217;t have the talent for it.</p> <p>Good news: The method I am practicing is one of the top-tier martial arts techniques, a secret technique from the Daoist sect.</p> <p>Bad news: With my talent, it could take thirty or forty years of hard practice just to reach the second rank.</p> <p>"Well, I&#8217;ll take it slow, there&#8217;s no rush." Chen Ye comforted himself. "Anyway, I have the system. Raising a child can earn me lifespan rewards, and I&#8217;ve got plenty of time!"</p> <p>Chen Ye could only force himself to feel better.</p> <p>"Let me check today&#8217;s fortune."</p> <p>Chen Ye focused his mind and activated the Star-gazing room&#8217;s daily divination feature.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[The sun and moon shift, the stars change their positions, and you keenly sense the anomaly. Your heart trembles, and you gain an insight!]</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[From the celestial phenomena, you learn about the fortune of the members of the Orphanage on July 17th.]</p> <p>Xiao Fu: Neutral, no issues.</p> <p>Da Ming: Neutral, no issues.</p> <p>Sun Sheng: Bad, everything is going wrong.</p> <p>Xiao Lian: Great misfortune, with the clash of the Hai and Zi signs. She refuses to endure humiliation and ends her life by committing suicide.</p> <p>TL Notes:&#160;</p> <p>Hai and Zi Signs: They are part of the Chinese zodiac signs representing the 12 Earthly Branches used in Chinese metaphysics.

                            </p><p>Chen Ye furrowed his brow.</p> <p>"Great misfortune, the clash of the Hai and Zi signs, and she will die by committing suicide?" Chen Ye muttered as he interpreted Xiao Lian's fortune. "Does this mean that tonight, during the time between Hai and Zi, Xiao Lian will commit suicide?"</p> <p>Having deciphered the meaning of the fortune, Chen Ye took a deep breath, and his gaze turned more profound.</p> <p>He looked out at the dimming sky through the window, sighing, "This is truly worrying."</p> <p>Chen Ye calmly finished dressing, opened the door, and picked up the broom in the yard, beginning to sweep the courtyard.</p> <p>Since he now knew the exact time when Xiao Lian was in danger, there was no need to hurry.</p> <p>He could sweep the courtyard, cook, and do other tasks first.</p> <p>Once the afternoon chores were done, he could set off without rushing.</p> <p>The clash of the Hai and Zi signs corresponded to around 11 PM (Hai time is between 9 and 10 PM, and Zi time is between 11 PM and 1 AM).</p> <p>Using the Ground Shrinking Step, he would be able to find Xiao Lian in no time.</p> <p>Chen Ye continued sweeping the yard calmly.</p> <p>Perhaps it was due to practicing the Innate Qi Skill, but he found himself becoming more patient.</p> <p>Just as Daoist texts described, the heart should be still and calm.</p> <p>Chen Ye had only swept a few times when Sun Sheng rushed out of the house, still wearing his clothes and yawning as he ran.</p> <p>"Foster Father, I got up a bit late..."</p> <p>Sun Sheng was still half-asleep, his eyes half-closed, reaching out to take the broom from Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled faintly. "No worries, you can go back to sleep."</p> <p>"How late did you stay up last night reading the Water Margin comics?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng scratched his head awkwardly and mumbled, "I think it was until the third watch."</p> <p>The third watch refers to midnight.</p> <p>It was now 5 AM, meaning Sun Sheng had only slept for six hours, which explained why he had just woken up.</p> <p>Since joining the Orphanage eight days ago, Sun Sheng had worked hard, his mind sharp and his hands quick.</p> <p>Every time the roosters crowed, he would get up to sweep the yard and tend to the stove, easing Chen Ye&#8217;s workload.</p> <p>A few days ago, Sun Sheng had entered the study, found some comic books like Water Margin and Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and this opened up a new world for him.</p> <p>Chen Ye allowed him to read, but he insisted that Sun Sheng must learn every word on each page.</p> <p>Sun Sheng, eager to learn, had picked up many characters over the past few days.</p> <p>However, this habit also led to late nights occasionally.</p> <p>"Don&#8217;t stay up too late. The books won&#8217;t run away," Chen Ye advised, but said no more.</p> <p>He understood Sun Sheng's feelings&#8212;when he was younger, he had been addicted to the internet and stayed up all night.</p> <p>It wasn&#8217;t easy to stop once it became an addiction.</p> <p>The morning breeze gently blew, bringing a coolness to the air.</p> <p>Sun Sheng took a few deep breaths to wake up and said, "Foster Father, I&#8217;ll go light the stove."</p> <p>Seeing that Sun Sheng didn&#8217;t plan to sleep any longer, Chen Ye didn&#8217;t insist.</p> <p>He had originally not accepted the title of "Foster Father", but after hearing Sun Sheng&#8217;s story, he relented.</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s father had passed away early, and two years ago, his mother had also died from illness, leaving him with no relatives. For the next two years, he had wandered the streets, hungry and bullied, enduring hardships.</p> <p>When he arrived at the Orphanage, he had found a warmth he hadn&#8217;t experienced in a long time.</p> <p>Calling Chen Ye "Foster Father" was a gesture from the heart, and he was willing to do so.</p> <p>After hearing this, Chen Ye sighed and accepted the title.</p> <p>This world was not easy for anyone.</p> <p>By the time Chen Ye finished sweeping the yard, Da Ming returned, drenched in sweat and steaming as he ran back from outside.</p> <p>Da Ming had developed a habit of morning runs following the Schwarzenegger Exercise Manual, getting up with the rooster&#8217;s crow and running through the forest outside the town.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t mind. Morning exercise was a good habit, and since Da Ming had the All-round Development Skill, his physical training would also enhance other qualities, which was ultimately a good thing.</p> <p>Chen Ye had no high expectations for Da Ming; he simply hoped he could live a peaceful life as a woodcutter.</p> <p>When Da Ming returned, Chen Ye entered the kitchen to prepare breakfast, and Sun Sheng helped him out.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>The sound of horse hooves gradually slowed.</p> <p>A little girl peeked out through the window of the carriage, looking outside.</p> <p>The carriage had stopped in a small village, surrounded by several other carriages parked side by side.</p> <p>The little girl withdrew her gaze. She didn&#8217;t know what awaited her, but all she could do was wait.</p> <p>On the large carriage, there were many children besides her, all about the same age, around six or seven years old. They were all pale and thin, clearly in a state of long-term malnutrition.</p> <p>They, like the little girl, remained silent, their eyes dull.</p> <p>They quietly waited for whatever fate awaited them.</p> <p>"Your Highness, these are orphans left by the chaos of war."</p> <p>A deep voice sounded not far away.</p> <p>The little girl looked through the window, following the sound, and saw a person dressed in dark armor, his hands clasped in a respectful salute, speaking to a middle-aged man who wore a mask.</p> <p>The mask on the middle-aged man was engraved with a pattern of wind and rain, giving it an eerie look.</p> <p>"From now on, there is no 'Your Highness', only the master of Fengyu Tower."</p> <p>"Take them to eat a full meal, and get them some new clothes."</p> <p>"Once that&#8217;s done, bring them back here."</p> <p>The middle-aged man's voice was calm, but his tone carried the authority of someone in a superior position.</p> <p>"Yes! Your&#8211; Master!"</p> <p>"Mm, go ahead."</p> <p>The person in the dark armor bowed respectfully and left.</p> <p>The masked middle-aged man seemed to sense something and looked towards the little girl.</p> <p>She met his gaze, and a tremor ran through her young heart.</p> <p>His eyes were filled with bloodlust and hatred, like an injured wild beast.</p> <p>The scene in the dream shifted.</p> <p>In a tranquil and elegant bamboo house.</p> <p>The middle-aged man wearing the wind-and-rain mask slowly picked up a purple clay teapot from the small table, pouring clear, fragrant tea into a cup.</p> <p>He poured the tea, then pushed the cup across the table.</p> <p>"Drink this tea, and from now on, you will be my personal disciple."</p> <p>On the opposite side of the table, a girl in a black dress, with fair skin and delicate features, though still young, knelt.</p> <p>She took the tea and drank it all at once, setting the cup down, and said in a flat voice, "Yes."</p> <p>The middle-aged man smiled and shook his head.&#160;</p> <p>"This is not how tea should be drunk."</p> <p>The girl said nothing but slightly raised her head to meet his gaze.</p> <p>In his eyes, the bloodlust and hatred from before had disappeared.</p> <p>Instead, there was only an endless depth and tranquility.</p> <p>The girl looked into his eyes for a moment before lowering her head again.</p> <p>At that moment, a thought suddenly emerged in her mind: The bloodlust and hatred he once had were now buried deep within him.</p> <p>The man before her, elegant and composed, was now a beast hiding its thirst for vengeance.</p> <p>The scene shattered.</p> <p>The past dream faded into darkness.</p> <p>Qin Yi, dressed in white undergarments, slowly opened her eyes, her heart pounding violently.</p> <p>After several deep breaths, her heartbeat gradually calmed.</p> <p>She sat up, her body drenched, sweat dripping from her forehead.</p> <p>Qin Yi's gaze was calm as her right hand reached from under the blanket to casually wipe away the sweat from her forehead.</p> <p>She sat there, staring into the dim room, unmoving for a long time.</p> <p>Under the blanket, her left hand tightly gripped her sword.</p> <p>Tightly.</p> <p>Very tightly.</p> <p>Yuyu: I wonder why QY keeps dreaming about her childhood. This kind of foreshadowing is very nice. I hope the author keeps up the suspense.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"Master? Another nightmare?"</p> <p>In the dimly lit room, Xiao Lian's crisp voice came from the bed opposite.</p> <p>Qin Yi snapped out of her daze. Her face looked slightly pale, and she shook her head. "I'm fine. You go back to sleep. I'm going out for a walk."</p> <p>She sat up, pushed aside the quilt, and got out of bed.</p> <p>"Cock-a-doodle-doo..."</p> <p>The sound of roosters crowing echoed throughout the city.</p> <p>Hearing the unrelenting crowing, Xiao Lian sat up, gently brushing her hair behind her ears. She glanced toward the paper-covered window, where a faint trace of light seeped through.</p> <p>Her delicate face bore a hint of weariness from the long journey. She murmured softly, "It&#8217;s already dawn."</p> <p>Qin Yi took a deep breath and said calmly, "Let&#8217;s get ready, then. One more morning&#8217;s travel, and we&#8217;ll reach the tower."</p> <p>Xiao Lian nodded without further comment.</p> <p>Since the eighth day of the seventh lunar month, they had been traveling for ten days straight. Now, they were less than 45 li from Fengyu Tower&#8217;s &#8216;Upper Pavilion&#8217;."</p> <p>One more morning, and they&#8217;d arrive.</p> <p>After washing up, the two left their room and went to the inn's main hall.</p> <p>Of the four other assassins in their group, only the scholarly Zhou Ba sat at a table, a paper fan in hand, reading a scripture. He seemed deeply engrossed.</p> <p>Qin Yi sat on a bench with her sword and said to Xiao Lian, "In a bit, I'll take you to restock some concealed weapons. There may be a fierce battle ahead, so it&#8217;s best to poison your weapons."</p> <p>After days of travel, Xiao Lian&#8217;s face was pale, lacking vitality. She nodded. "Understood."</p> <p>Zhou Ba, noticing their arrival, closed his scripture and greeted them with a bow. "Miss Qin, Miss Chen."</p> <p>Both Qin Yi and Xiao Lian gave slight nods in response.</p> <p>After waiting a short while, the other three assassins descended from the inn&#8217;s upper floor.</p> <p>After breakfast, the group decided to split up and make preparations.</p> <p>Qin Yi took Xiao Lian and left the inn.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Walking along a cobblestone street, Qin Yi suddenly stopped and entered a grain shop.</p> <p>It was still early, so the shop was empty, save for a yawning attendant.</p> <p>Xiao Lian didn&#8217;t understand why Qin Yi brought her here, but as they entered, she noticed a copper coin emblem carved into the counter.</p> <p>That emblem represented Wan Jin Hall.</p> <p>Xiao Lian recalled information she&#8217;d heard from Huang San and the others&#8212;this was a Wan Jin Hall business?</p> <p>Draped in a black dress, her figure graceful, Qin Yi&#8217;s face was veiled in black gauze. She approached the counter and tapped lightly, saying coolly, "Golden light illuminates the four corners."</p> <p>The yawning attendant instantly perked up, a shrewd smile spreading across his face. "Wan Jin Hall gathers heroes."</p> <p>After glancing outside, he extended his left hand to gesture politely. "This way, please."</p> <p>Qin Yi followed him to a back room, Xiao Lian trailing behind while silently memorizing the code words.</p> <p>"Please wait here," the attendant said, bowing before leaving.</p> <p>Seated, Qin Yi explained to Xiao Lian, "Wan Jin Hall has shops all over the land.</p> <p>"When you roam the Jianghu, if you see this emblem on a shop counter, say the code, and they&#8217;ll take you to a back room to trade martial goods."</p> <p>Xiao Lian hesitated. "Isn&#8217;t Wan Jin Hall supposed to send experts to deal with us?"</p> <p>"Wan Jin Hall primarily runs businesses. Most of their people aren&#8217;t martial artists." Qin Yi&#8217;s tone remained calm. "The warriors they hire belong to twelve branch halls and only act when necessary. So, there&#8217;s no need to worry."</p> <p>Xiao Lian nodded in understanding.</p> <p>Shortly after, footsteps approached from outside.</p> <p>An elderly man in fine robes entered and asked, "What would you like to purchase?"</p> <p>"Three bags of Tang Sect concealed weapons, any type. Four bottles each of strong poison and antidote," Qin Yi replied plainly, producing 95 taels of silver.</p> <p>The old man accepted the note, nodded, and said, "Please wait a moment."</p> <p>With that, he left.</p> <p>---</p> <p>95 taels of silver...</p> <p>Seeing Qin Yi hand over the banknote, Xiao Lian&#8217;s heart raced.</p> <p>Those items were that expensive?</p> <p>At the orphanage, her monthly stipend was only 4 taels of silver.</p> <p>This was equivalent to two years of her earnings.</p> <p>Even a head maid in a wealthy household only made about 120 taels a year.</p> <p>Noticing Xiao Lian&#8217;s thoughts, Qin Yi&#8217;s tone carried a faint smile.</p> <p>"A bag of Tang Sect concealed weapons contains 50 pieces, each costing 100 copper coins. Strong poison and antidotes are 10 taels per bottle. Martial world goods are costly&#8212;you&#8217;ll understand in time.&#8221;</p> <p>"Your current weapons, crafted by ordinary blacksmiths, may follow Tang Sect designs, but they&#8217;re inferior in weight, material, and balance. Once you have the real thing, get used to them quickly."</p> <p>Xiao Lian mentally calculated the costs, her delicate face showing conflict.</p> <p>Against evenly matched opponents, killing one person with concealed weapons could take 6-7 pieces.</p> <p>That&#8217;s 300-350 copper coins per kill.</p> <p>With her 4-tael monthly salary...</p> <p>Xiao Lian puffed up her cheeks, suddenly regretting her decision to learn about hidden weapons.</p> <p>Hidden weapons are really expensive.</p> <p>Qin Yi sighed lightly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pity the Tang Sect only sells concealed weapons and not their secret poisons. If they did, you could hold your own against a second-rank martial artist with weaker qinggong.&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s bright eyes widened. &#8220;The hidden weapons we&#8217;re buying are from the Tang Sect?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Qin Yi confirmed. &#8220;Tang Sect hidden weapons are renowned across the Jianghu. Most of their revenue comes from selling these weapons and carrying out assassinations. But in recent years, Fengyu Tower has taken a lot of their assassination business.&#8221;</p> <p>Qin Yi continued explaining Jianghu knowledge to Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Before long, the elderly man returned, handing over several embroidered pouches to Qin Yi.</p> <p>With the concealed weapons and poisons secured, Qin Yi and Xiao Lian left the Wan Jin Hall shop.</p> <p>They returned to the inn and reunited with the other four assassins. The six of them then set off toward Jiangxia County.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Creak&#8230;</p> <p>Chen Ye pushed open the door and stepped out.</p> <p>&#8220;Foster Father!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng, who had been doing push-ups in the courtyard, stopped mid-movement. Seeing Chen Ye dressed entirely in black, his expression froze.</p> <p>Standing at the door in a fitted black outfit, Chen Ye&#8217;s long hair was neatly tied back, his gaze deep and unreadable.</p> <p>Unlike the usual warmth in his demeanor, Chen Ye now exuded an aura Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t quite describe.</p> <p>It was like the ominous black clouds of a stormy sky&#8212;calm on the surface, yet threatening to unleash thunder, lightning, and torrential rain at any moment.</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye&#8217;s composed expression, a trace of unease stirred in Sun Sheng&#8217;s heart, as though beneath that calm exterior lay surging waves and a brewing storm.</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded slightly at Sun Sheng. &#8220;I need to take care of something.</p> <p>&#8220;If all goes well, I&#8217;ll be back in a day. If not, three days at the latest.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Da Ming has gone up the mountain to chop wood. You&#8217;ll take care of Xiao Fu for now, and once Da Ming returns, you can switch duties with him.&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye&#8217;s calm demeanor, Sun Sheng lowered his head, feeling an inexplicable sense of intimidation. With a respectful tone, he replied, &#8220;Understood!&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded lightly and left the orphanage.</p> <p>After walking a short distance, he pulled out a silver mask from his robes. The mask&#8217;s edges were engraved with a delicate leaf motif.</p> <p>Chen Ye gently placed it over his face. Taking a steady step forward, he instantly appeared thirty zhang away.</p> <p>Within a few strides, his figure vanished from the bustling streets.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Outside Jiangxia County, Ezhou.</p> <p>Chen Er, the burly man with a cloak covering the Purple-Gold Hammer on his back, pulled on the reins of his red horse and softly muttered, &#8220;Whoa, whoa&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>The horse trotted a few more steps before slowly coming to a halt.</p> <p>Qin Yi and Xiao Lian also reined in their horses.</p> <p>In the distance, the massive characters carved into the gray-green city walls read: Jiangxia County.</p> <p>&#8220;We&#8217;re finally here.&#8221;</p> <p>The scholarly-looking Zhou Ba gazed at the words &#8220;Jiangxia County,&#8221; a mixture of nostalgia and sentiment in his eyes.</p> <p>He looked like a wanderer returning home, his anticipation tinged with unease.</p> <p>Huang San, who had been half-asleep with his arms crossed atop his horse, cracked his eyes open, a sharp glint flashing through them. Spitting out the blade of grass in his mouth, he dismounted smoothly.</p> <p>Plucking another blade of grass from the roadside, Huang San placed it between his lips and chewed thoughtfully. &#8220;The grass here in Jiangxia still tastes the freshest,&#8221; he remarked.</p> <p>Qian Qi, now dressed in her feminine attire and riding a yellow horse, glanced at Huang San chewing the grass. Her clear, melodious voice carried a hint of disdain. &#8220;When will you ever drop that habit?&#8221;</p> <p>She wore a red dress and carried a small bamboo basket on her back. Her face was veiled, revealing only her snow-white forehead and neck.</p> <p>Her brows and eyes were charming, though she still appeared a bit youthful&#8212;likely only a few years older than Xiao Lian.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll quit when you throw out all your precious treasures,&#8221; Huang San replied nonchalantly.</p> <p>Qian Qi snorted softly and ignored him.</p> <p>The six of them dismounted, blending in with the common folk heading toward the city gate. After paying the entrance fee, they entered Jiangxia.</p> <p>Walking along the cobbled streets, Zhou Ba sighed, &#8220;It&#8217;s been so many years since I last returned&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>His eyes reflected a deep longing as he took in the familiar sights around him.</p> <p>This time, even the usually gruff Chen Er did not refute Zhou Ba. Instead, he nodded, his voice uncharacteristically soft. &#8220;Ever since I became an Iron Token assassin, I&#8217;ve been out in the world fighting. Years have passed in the blink of an eye&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San, chewing his grass, remained silent, his gaze lingering on the streets as a hint of sorrow for time&#8217;s fleeting nature surfaced in his eyes.</p> <p>Qin Yi explained to Xiao Lian, &#8220;Once we became Iron Token assassins, we left Jiangxia. Without the Tower Master&#8217;s orders or a Fengyu Token, we&#8217;re forbidden to return.&#8221;</p> <p>Her usually calm voice carried a touch of reminiscence.</p> <p>The mention of Jiangxia seemed to stir something in all five assassins.</p> <p>Perhaps Jiangxia held a special place in their hearts.</p> <p>For those who wandered far from home, there was always a place they yearned for.</p> <p>Xiao Lian watched their expressions and couldn&#8217;t help but think of that small courtyard and Chen Ye&#8217;s gentle smile.</p> <p>She pressed her lips together, suppressing her emotions. She wanted to return to the orphanage, but she had a mission. She had to kill that person.</p> <p>She would kill that person.</p> <p>A flash of hatred crossed Xiao Lian&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>---</p> <p>&#8220;Hmm? Isn&#8217;t that King Zhentian, Li Yi, from Guandong?&#8221;</p> <p>Zhou Ba&#8217;s scholarly gaze fell on a man in the inn&#8217;s main hall. The man wore simple yellow linen, his bronzed chest exposed. Beside him lay a long staff wrapped in cloth.</p> <p>Li Yi, King Zhentian, sat alone, savoring a few small dishes and a jar of wine.</p> <p>&#8220;The assassins from Guandong are here, so we&#8217;re not too late,&#8221; Chen Er said with a hearty laugh, striding toward Li Yi.</p> <p>&#8220;King Zhentian? That&#8217;s his title?&#8221; Xiao Lian asked Qin Yi.</p> <p>Qin Yi nodded. &#8220;Li Yi is the only survivor among the Li-generation assassins. His staff techniques have nearly reached the first rank. They say one strike from his staff can suppress even the heavens.&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian pondered this, realizing she didn&#8217;t know the titles of her companions yet.</p> <p>&#8220;Big Sister Qi, what&#8217;s your nickname?&#8221; she asked Qian Qi.</p> <p>After a few days together, Xiao Lian had grown close to Qian Qi, given their similar ages.</p> <p>Qian Qi chuckled. &#8220;My nickname is simple: Serpent Maiden.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Chen Er&#8217;s is the Purple-Gold King, and Zhou Ba&#8217;s is the Precision Scholar.&#8221;</p> <p>She turned to Huang San with a teasing smile. &#8220;As for your Brother Huang, his nickname is the simplest, but also the most dangerous&#8212;Swift Blade.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Anyone below the first rank won&#8217;t even see his blade before their head hits the ground.&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San smirked lazily at her words, offering no rebuttal.</p> <p>Xiao Lian nodded thoughtfully, committing their titles to memory.</p> <p>In the Jianghu, titles reflected a warrior&#8217;s personality, weapon, and strengths&#8212;serving as their public label.</p> <p>The group of five entered the inn, where Chen Er had already begun drinking with Li Yi.</p> <p>&#8220;Brother Li, do you know why the Tower Master summoned us here this time?&#8221; Chen Er asked casually, downing a bowl of wine.</p> <p>Li Yi, known as King Zhentian, was a man of few words. He shook his head, replying in a low voice, &#8220;No idea.&#8221;</p> <p>As Huang San walked by, he paused, his brows furrowing slightly. The laziness in his demeanor vanished for an instant.</p> <p>&#8230;</p> <p>Jiangxia County.</p> <p>Chen Ye stood still, sweat forming on his brow as he gazed at the three large characters carved into the distant city walls.</p> <p>&#8220;Quite a trek,&#8221; he muttered.</p> <p>Glancing at his watch, Chen Ye noted that the journey from Yuhang to here had taken nearly an hour.</p> <p>If not for the inner strength he had cultivated, which greatly boosted his stamina, it would&#8217;ve taken even longer.</p> <p>Pulling up the system map, he confirmed the red dot representing Xiao Lian was within Jiangxia County.</p> <p>Chen Ye slowed his pace, circulating his internal energy to adjust his breathing.</p> <p>Blending in with the commoners along the main road, he entered the city.</p> <p>---</p> <p>No sooner had he stepped inside than his eyes caught sight of a martial artist with a copper coin emblem embroidered on his sleeve, entering an apothecary.</p> <p>On the apothecary's counter was a carved copper coin.</p> <p>Wan Jin Hall?</p> <p>Chen Ye recalled the ambush Wan Jin Hall had set up against Fengyu Tower assassins outside Jiangning City.</p> <p>&#8220;Jiangxia is Fengyu Tower&#8217;s headquarters. Could Wan Jin Hall&#8217;s presence here mean Xiao Lian&#8217;s trouble tonight is connected to them?&#8221;</p> <p>His brows furrowed as he contemplated the connection.</p> <p>With a step, Chen Ye used Ground Shrinking Step to appear outside the apothecary in an instant.</p> <p>Inside, he overheard the martial artist speaking with the shop clerk.</p> <p>The martial artist approached the counter and said indifferently, &#8220;Gold flows through the world&#8212;where can its tracks be found?&#8221;</p> <p>The clerk glanced around discreetly before replying, &#8220;As rivers meet the sea, moonlight reflects golden faces.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, the martial artist cupped his hands slightly, revealing the copper coin emblem on his sleeve, and added, &#8220;An ape leaps through the forest, seeking hidden paths; the moon&#8217;s golden shadow reflects upon green robes.&#8221;</p> <p>Recognizing the emblem, the clerk smiled faintly and gestured, &#8220;This way, please.&#8221;</p> <p>The martial artist followed him into a back room.</p> <p>---</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s eyes narrowed as he committed the exchange to memory.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about the passphrase; the clothing emblem matters too.</p> <p>&#8220;I wonder if tonight&#8217;s events are tied to Wan Jin Hall.&#8221;</p> <p>Frowning, Chen Ye turned into a deserted alley.</p> <p>When he emerged moments later, his black attire had been replaced by a plain coarse yellow robe, with a copper coin emblem now embroidered on the sleeve.</p> <p>His mask had also changed to a red-and-white patterned faceplate.</p> <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if I can infiltrate them&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye had already made up his mind.</p> <p>If Wan Jin Hall&#8217;s presence here had nothing to do with Fengyu Tower, he would quietly get Xiao Lian before sunset.</p> <p>As for the others&#8217; fates, they had nothing to do with him.</p> <p>After all, Chen Ye currently had only two system skills: Defence and Escape&#8212;but no Combat.</p> <p>If he had even one combat-related skill, he wouldn&#8217;t have to hide his identity.</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Lian&#8217;s gratitude level is already at 79%. One more percent, and I&#8217;ll get another draw,&#8221; Chen Ye mused with a sigh.</p> <p>&#8220;System, could you grant me a combat skill already?&#8221;</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Jiangxia County, Xiaofeng Village.</p> <p>Qin Yi and the five others walked along a muddy country road, flanked by fields of crops on either side.</p> <p>A few village dogs stood on the dirt path, barking as they spotted outsiders entering the village.</p> <p>Huang San, with a grass stem in his mouth, maintained his usual lazy demeanor, though a sharp glint flickered in his eyes. He said indifferently, "Li Yi doesn&#8217;t know why the Master summoned him back."</p> <p>"Perhaps none of the others know either," Zhou Ba, gently fanning himself with a paper fan, added.</p> <p>"Why bother speculating? Qin Yi will see the Master soon enough, and everything will be clear," Chen Er remarked loudly, his tone carefree.</p> <p>His face was flushed; he&#8217;d just had a few drinks with Li Yi.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Li Yi wanted to linger in the city for a while and hadn&#8217;t joined them on their journey.</p> <p>Qin Yi remained silent, observing the rural scenery. Past memories intertwined with the nightmares of the past few days, and a vague sense of unease began to creep into her heart&#8212;a mix of fear and foreboding.</p> <p>Suppressing her emotions, her calm, autumn-water eyes regained their serenity.</p> <p>From the moment she became an assassin, her life was no longer her own.</p> <p>"This village is the true headquarters of Fengyu Tower," Qin Yi explained to her disciple. "Probably no one in the world would suspect that Fengyu Tower hides in a place like this."</p> <p>Xiao Lian nodded, glancing around.</p> <p>The village was small, with fewer than a hundred households.</p> <p>It was incredibly ordinary, no different from any other village Xiao Lian had seen before.</p> <p>If Qin Yi hadn&#8217;t said anything, Xiao Lian would&#8217;ve thought they were merely passing through.</p> <p>The six entered the village, and Qin Yi stopped, turning to Huang San.</p> <p>"Qin Yi, as the master&#8217;s personal disciple, the master will definitely see you," Huang San said, his usual laziness replaced by a rare seriousness.</p> <p>He gave a stern reminder: "Ask the master about his stance on the Shenji Sect, Wan Jin Hall, and Tang Sect."</p> <p>Qin Yi glanced at Huang San indifferently but said nothing.</p> <p>Huang San pulled out a golden token engraved with storm patterns and tossed it to Qin Yi.</p> <p>The Storm Token.</p> <p>One of Fengyu Tower&#8217;s prized items, the Storm Token could only be exchanged by gold-ranked assassins, requiring a significant amount of merit points.</p> <p>Possessing the Storm Token granted one audience with the master.</p> <p>According to Fengyu Tower&#8217;s rules, assassins couldn&#8217;t return to Jiangxia without the master&#8217;s summons&#8212;even personal disciples were no exception.</p> <p>Qin Yi accepted the token and walked toward the village shrine.</p> <p>She pushed open the shrine&#8217;s doors, revealing a row of ancestral tablets placed on an altar.</p> <p>Offerings and an incense burner adorned the altar, with several sticks of incense burning, their smoke curling into the air.</p> <p>Beside the altar sat an elderly man in plain gray robes, his hair white as snow. His eyes were half-closed, as if he&#8217;d dozed off.</p> <p>Qin Yi walked to his side and gently nudged his shoulder.</p> <p>The old man awoke with a start, and upon seeing Qin Yi, he smiled warmly, nodding in greeting.</p> <p>He only had half a tongue and couldn&#8217;t speak.</p> <p>Qin Yi treated the elder with great respect, her tone losing its usual indifference.</p> <p>"Uncle Ya, I wish to see the master," she said, taking out the Storm Token and holding it before him.</p> <p>The old man&#8217;s eyes flashed with surprise upon seeing the token.</p> <p>He accepted it and nodded.</p> <p>"Thank you, Uncle Ya," Qin Yi said respectfully.</p> <p>The elder waved his hand casually, his smile never fading.</p> <p>Placing the Storm Token into his robe, he stood up from his chair.</p> <p>Though his age seemed advanced, his steps were steady and quick, not at all like an old man&#8217;s faltering gait.</p> <p>Uncle Ya pushed open the shrine&#8217;s rear door and walked out, disappearing from sight.</p> <p>Qin Yi sat quietly inside, waiting.</p> <p>---</p> <p>The village&#8217;s back mountain.</p> <p>Uncle Ya arrived in front of a bamboo building.</p> <p>Climbing the creaky stairs with practiced ease, he ascended to the second floor.</p> <p>There, the master of Fengyu Tower, dressed in black embroidered robes with gold patterns along the hem, sat before a small tea table, sipping tea as usual.</p> <p>Standing nearby was a eunuch in a purple robe, gazing into the distant mountains.</p> <p>The master&#8217;s brow furrowed slightly as Uncle Ya appeared.</p> <p>Approaching the master, Uncle Ya produced the golden Storm Token from his robe and gestured with his hands.</p> <p>The eunuch, who had been watching the mountain view, turned his attention to Uncle Ya, narrowing his eyes as he scrutinized the man.</p> <p>For some reason, the eunuch felt a vague familiarity, as though he&#8217;d seen the old man somewhere before.</p> <p>But it had been too many years; he couldn&#8217;t recall.</p> <p>Few have left a lasting impression on him.</p> <p>Lord Wang stared at the old man&#8217;s face, trying to summon a memory buried in the depths of time.</p> <p>&#8220;I understand. Tell her, no.&#8221;</p> <p>Although Uncle Ya hadn&#8217;t spoken, the master of Fengyu Tower understood his intention.</p> <p>Hearing the reply, Uncle Ya grinned, nodded, and tucked the golden token back into his robe.</p> <p>He descended the stairs briskly, his gait light and cheerful, nothing like an old man.</p> <p>Throughout, Uncle Ya didn&#8217;t spare Lord Wang a single glance.</p> <p>&#8220;Who was that? Why does he seem so familiar to me?&#8221; Lord Wang asked in his sharp, high-pitched voice.</p> <p>The master of Fengyu Tower smiled. &#8220;He&#8217;s my personal servant. As for the familiarity, perhaps Lord Wang is mistaken. The ones you&#8217;re familiar with were all wiped out by my imperial brother eighteen years ago.&#8221;</p> <p>Lord Wang gave the master a sidelong glance but said nothing.</p> <p>Turning back to the verdant mountains, he said sharply, &#8220;Tonight, it&#8217;s time, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p> <p>The master of Fengyu Tower nodded, lifting his teacup and taking a small sip. &#8220;The assassins from Guandong have all arrived.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p> <p>A satisfied expression flickered across Lord Wang&#8217;s pale, beardless face.</p> <p>&#8220;Tonight, the Wan Jin Hall and Tang Sect will make their move.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;By dawn, Fengyu Tower will cease to exist.&#8221;</p> <p>He stared at the distant mountains as though a great burden had been lifted from his heart.</p> <p>The master of Fengyu Tower said nothing, sipping his tea one mouthful at a time.</p> <p>His gaze deepened, becoming an abyss of unfathomable darkness.</p> <p>---</p> <p>The Village Shrine</p> <p>Uncle Ya returned through the rear door, his steps as lively as before.</p> <p>Seeing him, Qin Yi quickly stood and asked, &#8220;Uncle Ya, may I see the master now?&#8221;</p> <p>Her voice carried a trace of emotion and anticipation.</p> <p>Uncle Ya shook his head with a smile, pulling the golden token from his robe and handing it back to her.</p> <p>Beneath her black veil, Qin Yi&#8217;s delicate face froze for a moment. She asked softly, &#8220;The master won&#8217;t see me?&#8221;</p> <p>Uncle Ya nodded, still smiling.</p> <p>Confusion flickered in Qin Yi&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>She couldn&#8217;t understand why the master refused to see her.</p> <p>Uncle Ya, still smiling, suddenly took her hand and gently patted it twice, signaling her to extend her palm.</p> <p>Though puzzled, Qin Yi complied, holding her hand out.</p> <p>Uncle Ya traced a character onto her fair palm.</p> <p>After finishing, he smiled at her once more before returning to his chair.</p> <p>There, he sat with his eyes half-closed, his face serene, as though keeping vigil for the ancestral tablets on the altar.</p> <p>Qin Yi stared at her hand, lost in thought.</p> <p>Because Uncle Ya had written a single character: &#8220;Leave.&#8221;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Outside Jiangxia County</p> <p>A horse-drawn carriage trundled slowly along the main road.</p> <p>&#8220;Young master, Jiangxia County is just ahead,&#8221; the driver called toward the carriage.</p> <p>&#8220;Good. Once we&#8217;re in town, take me to Xiaofeng Village, and I&#8217;ll give you an extra two hundred copper coins,&#8221; replied a youthful voice from inside.</p> <p>The driver, hearing this, didn&#8217;t say more, though he couldn&#8217;t help but wonder why this young blind boy insisted on going to Jiangxia County.</p> <p>Inside the carriage, Tian Jizi, with his eyes covered by a black cloth, pulled three copper coins from his robe.</p> <p>He clasped them in his palm and gave them a light shake.</p> <p>The coins tumbled and fell. He traced the patterns on the coins with his fingertips, a complex and wistful expression crossing his face.</p> <p>&#8220;Who would&#8217;ve thought the opportunity lies there&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Has it really come to this?&#8221; he murmured softly, turning his sightless gaze toward a distant place.</p> <p>Thanks to @Nicholas Stokes for the subscription. &#129392;</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Jiangxiu County Streets</p> <p>Chen Ye strolled along the bustling street, his eyes catching sight of a copper coin mark carved onto a fabric shop&#8217;s counter.</p> <p>Inside, two women were selecting fabrics, chatting softly as they examined the colorful bolts.</p> <p>Chen Ye entered the shop, glanced at the shop assistant, and subtly lifted his sleeve to reveal a copper coin symbol on his wrist.</p> <p>The assistant noticed and quickly turned to the two women, saying, &#8220;Ladies, please wait a moment.&#8221;</p> <p>The women nodded, continuing to inspect the fabric and whisper to each other.</p> <p>The assistant approached Chen Ye, who lowered his voice and said, &#8220;Gold flows through the world&#8212;where can its tracks be found?&#8221;</p> <p>The assistant nodded slightly and replied, &#8220;As rivers meet the sea, moonlight reflects golden faces.&#8221;</p> <p>Without hesitation, Chen Ye responded, &#8220;An ape leaps through the forest, seeking hidden paths; the moon&#8217;s golden shadow reflects upon green robes.&#8221;</p> <p>The assistant smiled, bowed respectfully, and said, &#8220;Sir, the fabric you&#8217;re looking for is in the back courtyard. Please, follow me.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye gave a slight nod and followed the assistant through the back door to the courtyard.</p> <p>The assistant led him to a room in the rear courtyard, cupped his hands, and said, &#8220;So, you&#8217;re a brother from Qingyuan Hall. Please wait here; someone will come to take you to the hall.&#8221;</p> <p>With that, the assistant excused himself and left.</p> <p>Chen Ye sat patiently on a chair, pondering.</p> <p>Qingyuan Hall?</p> <p>The code earlier had indeed included the words ape and green.</p> <p>It was said that Wan Jin Hall had twelve halls in total, each headed by a hall master with at least second-grade martial arts skills.</p> <p>Chen Ye wondered about the Hall Master Qing&#8212;what their skills were and what they specialized in.</p> <p>As he mused, he recalled Smiling Cat Xu Xiaolin, the man he&#8217;d scared off outside Jiangning City.</p> <p>Which hall was he the master of?</p> <p>While deep in thought, the door creaked open, and an elder stepped in, his sharp gaze scrutinizing Chen Ye.</p> <p>&#8220;How many incense sticks have you burned at Qingyuan Hall, brother?&#8221; the elder asked.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s heart skipped a beat.</p> <p>Trouble. Another code.</p> <p>What did this one mean?</p> <p>Chen Ye sat still, his mind racing.</p> <p>Based on his knowledge of martial arts novels, this sort of code likely referred to either status or skill level.</p> <p>But what should he say?</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye&#8217;s hesitation, the elder&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</p> <p>In a flash of inspiration, Chen Ye decided to gamble.</p> <p>&#8220;Three sticks,&#8221; he said calmly.</p> <p>The elder nodded and replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m under the command of the Hall Master Tie. Tonight&#8217;s operation will be under Tieying Hall&#8217;s jurisdiction.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to the temporary base now.&#8221;</p> <p>With that, the elder turned and left.</p> <p>Chen Ye had guessed correctly.</p> <p>He surmised the code was about strength, and by saying three incense sticks, he indicated third-grade skills.</p> <p>Seeing the elder leave, Chen Ye followed without hesitation.</p> <p>Tonight&#8217;s operation.</p> <p>It seemed Wan Jin Hall was indeed preparing for action tonight.</p> <p>Could it be related to Fengyu Tower?</p> <p>Chen Ye pondered. Wan Jin Hall, conducting operations in Fengyu Tower&#8217;s territory&#8212;it was hard to believe it wasn&#8217;t aimed at them.</p> <p>But something puzzled Chen Ye: Fengyu Tower was reputed to have the best intelligence network in the world.</p> <p>How could Wan Jin Hall operate right under their noses without them reacting?</p> <p>The elder led Chen Ye out of the courtyard to a waiting carriage.</p> <p>Chen Ye climbed aboard, and the elder, holding a whip, lightly snapped it against the horse&#8217;s flank.</p> <p>The carriage began to move.</p> <p>Fifteen minutes later, they arrived at a secluded courtyard.</p> <p>&#8220;Get down. Someone will bring food at the hour of You. Don&#8217;t leave the courtyard unless necessary,&#8221; the elder instructed.</p> <p>Chen Ye disembarked and knocked lightly on the red-painted wooden door.</p> <p>The door creaked open, and a young man poked his head out, glancing at Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye raised his sleeve, displaying the copper coin insignia.</p> <p>The young man nodded slightly and gestured for him to enter.</p> <p>Inside the courtyard, Chen Ye was greeted by a peculiar scene.</p> <p>More than twenty chairs were arranged in neat rows, four per row, each occupied by a person.</p> <p>There were men and women, young and old.</p> <p>All sat with their backs to Chen Ye, straight and motionless.</p> <p>In the courtyard&#8217;s center was a bed, where a man wearing Wan Jin Hall&#8217;s signature yellow robe lay sideways, snoring loudly.</p> <p>The sight left Chen Ye dumbfounded.</p> <p>What kind of strange protocol was this?</p> <p>The snoring abruptly stopped, as though the man sensed someone entering.</p> <p>Without opening his eyes or changing his position, he spoke in a deep voice:</p> <p>&#8220;Which hall are you from?&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye replied calmly, &#8220;Qingyuan Hall.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;How many incense sticks?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Three sticks.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing Chen Ye&#8217;s answer, the man&#8217;s eyes snapped open. He slammed his left hand onto the bed, sending a powerful shockwave of inner force through the air.</p> <p>The thin layer of dust on the ground was blown away by the impact.</p> <p>The man suddenly launched himself forward, his movements fierce like an eagle in flight!</p> <p>His right hand formed a claw, aiming straight for Chen Ye&#8217;s face.</p> <p>Chen Ye remained composed.</p> <p>Ever since he had cultivated a small amount of inner force, his reflexes and physical condition had significantly improved.</p> <p>Moreover, the opponent&#8217;s attack wasn&#8217;t particularly fast, giving Chen Ye enough time to react.</p> <p>He raised his left arm lightly to block the incoming strike.</p> <p>At the same time, Chen Ye stayed alert for any follow-up moves, his mind racing.</p> <p>Did I mess up the code?</p> <p>Was I exposed?</p> <p>No&#8230; impossible. If he&#8217;d been exposed, the elder wouldn&#8217;t have brought him here.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s thoughts turned rapidly, trying to discern why the man had attacked.</p> <p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p> <p>The man let out a surprised grunt upon seeing Chen Ye neither dodge nor evade, merely raising his left arm to defend.</p> <p>Clang! A metallic sound rang out as the man&#8217;s claw struck Chen Ye&#8217;s arm.</p> <p>Using the momentum, the man leaped into the air and landed with a single foot on the back of a chair, balancing like a fierce eagle.</p> <p>His sturdy frame stood steady, his sharp gaze fixed on Chen Ye.</p> <p>Chen Ye lowered his left arm, standing tall and unmoved like a pine tree.</p> <p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Impressive iron-body training!&#8221;</p> <p>The man praised him, clearly admiring Chen Ye&#8217;s unyielding stance.</p> <p>Chen Ye suddenly realized that his identity hadn&#8217;t been compromised.</p> <p>This was merely the man&#8217;s test.</p> <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221; the man asked abruptly.</p> <p>&#8220;Huadong,&#8221; Chen Ye replied in an even tone.</p> <p>The man seemed to commit the name to memory, pondering briefly.</p> <p>He then laughed. &#8220;You&#8217;re quite capable. Why not join my Tieying Hall? That lecherous ape isn&#8217;t worth following.&#8221;</p> <p>With these words, Chen Ye instantly understood who this man was.</p> <p>He was the Hall Master Tie!</p> <p>The young man who had opened the door earlier quickly interjected, &#8220;Hall Master, with such strength, Brother Hua would never be released by Hall Master Qing!&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying frowned, displeased. &#8220;So what? I&#8217;m not afraid of him.&#8221;</p> <p>Though his words were bold, Tie Ying leaped lightly from the chair and returned to his bed, choosing not to pursue the matter further.</p> <p>He sat cross-legged on the bed and smiled at Chen Ye. &#8220;Come, grab a chair and sit next to me.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very old, yet you&#8217;ve trained your body impressively. Although I only used third-grade strength, for you to take it without retreating a step is quite remarkable.&#8221;</p> <p>TL Notes:&#160;</p> <p>Qingyuan: Green ape. Which is why the code has both green and ape.</p> <p>Tieying: Iron Eagle</p> <p>Hour of You: Time between 5pm to 7pm</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>&#8220;The Tower Master won&#8217;t see me.&#8221; Qin Yi sat on a long bench, speaking in a calm tone.</p> <p>Huang San frowned deeply, muttering, &#8220;Why?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Why won&#8217;t the Tower Master see you?&#8221;</p> <p>At this moment, Huang San couldn&#8217;t figure out what the Tower Master was thinking.</p> <p>Nearby, Chen Er, who was shelling peanuts and eating them leisurely, said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t overthink it. The Tower Master must have his own plans. Since he called all the assassins back, he&#8217;ll probably inform us of the arrangements tomorrow or the day after. What&#8217;s the point of speculating? Might as well eat some peanuts. Here, Zhou Ba, try some.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Er handed a handful of peanuts to Zhou Ba, who was sitting beside him.</p> <p>Zhou Ba, looking sulky, thought about it and decided Chen Er made sense.</p> <p>He took the peanuts, started shelling them, and sighed, &#8220;We&#8217;re like eunuchs worrying more than the emperor. We&#8217;ll probably find out tomorrow or the day after.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing Zhou Ba agree, Chen Er grinned and clapped Zhou Ba heavily on the shoulder. &#8220;Finally, you&#8217;re on my side for once.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Cough, cough, cough&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Zhou Ba&#8217;s face turned red as he choked, spitting out a peanut that spun in the air before falling to the ground.</p> <p>Furious, he shouted, &#8220;Are you an idiot?! I&#8217;m eating peanuts here!&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Er&#8217;s brows furrowed. &#8220;I may be wrong, but weren&#8217;t you at fault too? Why shout so loud?&#8221;</p> <p>Zhou Ba retorted, &#8220;You&#8212;&#8221;</p> <p>The two soon scuffled and ended up wrestling outside the house.</p> <p>Qin Yi turned to the still-frowning Huang San and said calmly, &#8220;When I came out, Uncle Ya wrote a single character on my hand.&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San&#8217;s eyes flashed with sharpness. &#8220;What character?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Leave.&#8221;</p> <p>---</p> <p>Chen Ye sat beside Tie Ying, glancing at the neatly seated Wan Jin Hall members.</p> <p>They all looked at Chen Ye with admiration and respect.</p> <p>To withstand a strike from the Tie Ying Hall Master without stepping back was an impressive feat for someone at the third rank!</p> <p>Moreover, unlike them, Chen Ye didn&#8217;t have to sit upright in a chair.</p> <p>This made the gang members, who had been sitting for over an hour, envious beyond measure.</p> <p>Clad in yellow, with thick eyebrows and large eyes, Tie Ying reclined on his bed, looking at Chen Ye with a friendly tone. &#8220;Brother Hua, are you at the early or late stage of the third rank?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Early stage,&#8221; Chen Ye replied calmly.</p> <p>Tie Ying nodded thoughtfully. &#8220;I thought as much. Iron-body training takes a long time. Specializing in it makes you impervious to blades and resistant to inner force, but it slows progress in other areas.&#8221;</p> <p>Pointing at Chen Ye&#8217;s red mask with white markings, Tie Ying asked curiously, &#8220;Brother Hua, we&#8217;re all on the same side. Why wear a mask?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Are you trying to imitate that Gentleman Donghua?&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying teased and reached out his large, calloused hand to remove Chen Ye&#8217;s mask.</p> <p>Chen Ye stepped back slightly and said indifferently, &#8220;My face is ugly, unworthy of sight.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Tie Ying stopped and nodded in understanding. &#8220;Ah, I see. I thought you were mimicking that Gentleman Donghua&#160; who appeared when my brother-in-law took in disciples.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Young folks these days love wearing masks and imitating Donghua.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s interest piqued. &#8220;Your brother-in-law?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s Qing Xuzi, Zhang Zhiling.&#8221; Tie Ying feigned nonchalance, but his smug expression betrayed him.</p> <p>Clearly, he had been waiting for Chen Ye to ask.</p> <p>Tie Que, Tie Ying&#8230;</p> <p>&#8220;So, Hall Master Tie is from the Tie Clan of Guandong. I&#8217;ve long heard of your reputation.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye pieced together the connections and politely cupped his hands.</p> <p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; Tie Ying replied modestly, though his grin grew impossibly wide.</p> <p>It was clear he took great pride in being part of the Tie Clan.</p> <p>Suddenly, Chen Ye remembered Qing Xuzi.</p> <p>On the fourth of July, he had only three days left to live.</p> <p>Judging by the current date, Qing Xuzi should already be dead.</p> <p>&#8220;Hall Master Tie, I haven&#8217;t kept up with the martial world for a while. If I recall, on July 4th, Qing Xuzi took in two disciples, right?&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye seized the opportunity to probe further into the Qing Xuzi incident.</p> <p>Tie Ying shook his head. &#8220;Brother Hua, you&#8217;re mistaken.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;My brother-in-law only took one disciple, Xie Fei, a well-known swordsman from Guandong. On July 7th, before passing away, my brother-in-law transferred all his inner force to Xie Fei, raising him from a powerless man to the first rank.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Now, Xie Fei is a guest elder of Tieque Villa.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye blinked, then casually asked, &#8220;What about Donghua?&#8221;</p> <p>At the mention of Donghua, Chen Ye noticed the ordinary gang members in the courtyard wore complicated expressions&#8212;jealousy, admiration, reverence, and awe.</p> <p>This made Chen Ye even more curious about how his name had spread in the martial world after he left.</p> <p>Tie Ying reclined on his bed, speaking with a tinge of awe, &#8220;That Gentleman Donghua &#8230; truly a remarkable figure!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;On July 4th, two disciples were selected, but on the 5th, my brother-in-law only officially accepted Xie Fei.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;After that&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>At this point, Tie Ying&#8217;s expression turned odd.</p> <p>&#8220;My brother-in-law made a statement in the martial world.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; Chen Ye asked instinctively.</p> <p>&#8220;My brother-in-law said that he and Gentleman Donghua could only be considered equals and not master and disciple.&#8221;</p> <p>The ordinary gang members in the courtyard collectively took a deep breath, their faces full of envy.</p> <p>To be personally acknowledged by Qing Xuzi, the martial legend of two decades past, as an equal was an unparalleled honor!</p> <p>To think that twenty years ago, Qing Xuzi was the number one person under the Grandmasters!</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Chen Ye&#8217;s expression became strange.</p> <p>If it weren&#8217;t for the mask, Tie Ying would have certainly noticed something odd about him.</p> <p>Chen Ye knew that Zhang Zhiling was trying to flatter him.</p> <p>With his name in the Jianghu for twenty years, he was trying to use Chen Ye as a stepping stone to show his goodwill.</p> <p>A slight smile tugged at the corner of Chen Ye's mouth.</p> <p>Now, Chen Ye understood why the gang members in the yard had that expression on their faces.</p> <p>Tie Ying continued, &#8220;Since that day, young martial artists in the world have started wearing masks.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye blinked.</p> <p>Got it. He had become a trendsetter.</p> <p>&#8220;Though it&#8217;s not necessarily a good thing, the old master of Baihua Valley has heard that Donghua&#8217;s qinggong is unrivaled, and he&#8217;s decided to come out of retirement to meet Donghua.&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s tone shifted to one of regret.</p> <p>Chen Ye furrowed his brows slightly and casually asked, &#8220;The old master of Baihua Valley? What level of strength does he have?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;A Grandmaster. One of the five Grandmasters of this generation, and the only one who hasn&#8217;t retired,&#8221; Tie Ying said, his expression turning curious. &#8220;Brother Hua, how could you not know this?&#8221;</p> <p>Grandmaster?</p> <p>A Grandmaster had their eye on him?</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s expression shifted subtly under the mask. He suppressed his emotions and replied calmly, &#8220;I am solely focused on martial training and know little of these matters of the Jianghu.&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying burst into laughter upon hearing this, reaching out to pat Chen Ye on the shoulder.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Clang!</p> <p>The sound of metal clashing echoed as their contact produced a strong impact.</p> <p>&#8220;Hahaha! I didn&#8217;t expect Brother Hua to be such a diligent person. If only your qinggong was better, I might have mistaken you for Donghua!&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying laughed. &#8220;Brother Hua, you don&#8217;t know, that Gentleman Donghua came out of nowhere and knows very little about martial world traditions.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Hall Master Xu of the Yuhu Hall had the fortune of meeting him once and said that Donghua didn&#8217;t even know of the Wan Jin Hall. Truly a strange person.&#8221;</p> <p>Tie Ying chuckled to himself, feeling quite proud.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s eyelids twitched. He almost thought he had been exposed.</p> <p>If Tie Ying really had figured it out&#8230;</p> <p>There was nothing Chen Ye could do.</p> <p>System, can you give me something useful, like an offensive skill or something?</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed inwardly.</p> <p>But...</p> <p>Yu Hu, Hall Master Xu?</p> <p>Could it be the Smiling cat, Xu Xiaolin?</p> <p>He&#8217;s actually the Hall Master of the Yuhu Hall?</p> <p>Chen Ye almost laughed out loud.</p> <p>This is getting interesting.</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t notice the subtle change in Tie Ying&#8217;s tone when he mentioned the old master of Baihua Valley.</p> <p>At this moment, there was a knock at the door.</p> <p>&#8220;Hall Master Tie, dinner is ready.&#8221;</p> <p>A voice called from outside the door.</p> <p>Tie Ying sat up from the bed and waved his hand. &#8220;Alright, everyone stretch a bit. Get ready to eat. After the meal, we&#8217;ll adjust and then team up with the Tang Sect for the operation tonight.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I&#8217;ve been wanting to deal with those assassins from the Fengyu Tower for a long time!&#8221;</p> <p>"Kill them all, leave not a single one alive, ahahaha!"</p> <p>Hearing these words, Chen Ye's pupils suddenly contracted, his eyes narrowing.</p> <p>As expected...</p> <p>It's connected to Wan Jin Hall and the Tang Sect.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The night was pitch black, with the bright moon hanging high blanketing its cold light on the earth. The ground glowed white, it was as clear as day.</p> <p>Temporary Headquarters of Tieying Hall</p> <p>Tie Ying, lying sideways on his bed, abruptly opened his eyes. &#8220;What time is it?&#8221; he asked.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s precisely the Hour of the Pig,&#8221; replied a young man keeping watch over the dripping water clock.</p> <p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s move.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye, who had been meditating nearby, opened his eyes with a sharp glint.</p> <p>Finally, the operation was about to begin.</p> <p>He exhaled softly.</p> <p>After dinner that afternoon, Chen Ye had been waiting for Wan Jin Hall to take action. Through indirect probing, he had confirmed that Xiao Lian&#8217;s fate was tied to Wan Jin Hall and the Tang Clan.</p> <p>Hearing Tie Ying&#8217;s words, over a dozen hall members in the courtyard opened their eyes and leapt from their seats, eager and bloodthirsty, their expressions revealed their readiness to kill.</p> <p>Wan Jin Hall missions were always lucrative. Completing this one would ensure their comfort for a while.</p> <p>Tie Ying got up from his bed and led the way out of the courtyard. Utilizing his qinggong, he led the group southward.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at his system map&#8212;the direction was exactly where Xiao Lian was located.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Fifteen Minutes Later</p> <p>Tie Ying halted abruptly, taking cover in a field of crops. He gestured with his hand, and the group behind him stopped simultaneously. Ahead, the vague silhouette of a village could be seen.</p> <p>&#8220;Watch the forest. The moment you see lantern light, enter the village. Leave no one alive.&#8221; Tie Ying&#8217;s voice, now icy cold, carried none of the warmth it had held when speaking to Chen Ye.</p> <p>A chilling aura of killing intent emanated from him.</p> <p>The hall members concealed themselves and lay in wait for a lantern to light up in the eastern woods. An invisible pressure seemed to permeate the air, making it heavy.</p> <p>Blending into the group, Chen Ye casted a deep, penetrating gaze toward the village.&#160;</p> <p>Before long, a flicker of firelight suddenly illuminated the eastern woods. Its light starkly stood out in the vast dark night.</p> <p>The flames danced, illuminating the treetops.</p> <p>Tie Ying, seeing the lantern, charged toward the village without hesitation.</p> <p>The hall members followed closely, their qinggong techniques propelling them after Tie Ying.</p> <p>At the same time, Chen Ye noticed numerous shadows emerging from the outskirts of the village.</p> <p>Their goal was the same.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Chaos erupted as figures flooded the village.</p> <p>Guard dogs, unable to even bark, were silenced by deadly concealed weapons, collapsing lifelessly in courtyards.</p> <p>Pah! Pah!</p> <p>Wooden doors were smashed open. In a flash of cold steel, those sleeping inside didn&#8217;t even have time to scream before being hacked to death.</p> <p>The attackers, weapons in hand, wasted no time and swiftly moved to the next household.</p> <p>The village was soon filled with a cacophony of sounds&#8212;doors breaking, shouts, and anguished cries.</p> <p>The faint, metallic scent of blood began to permeate the air.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Pah!</p> <p>A door burst open violently.</p> <p>Swoosh&#8230;</p> <p>Came a sharp blade whistling down toward the bed.</p> <p>Qin Yi&#8217;s eyes snapped open. In an instant, a lighter, faster and sharper swing flashed.</p> <p>Dang!</p> <p>The long blade clattered to the ground.</p> <p>The attacker clutching his throat stared at Qin Yi with wide eyes before collapsing to the floor, lifeless.</p> <p>Qin Yi, moving like a ghost, wielding her sword with precision. Several swift flashes of her blade, and the four Wan Jin Hall members who had barged into her room met their end, their heads severed.</p> <p>The air inside the room became thick with the nauseating stench of blood.</p> <p>&#8220;Master?&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian, startled awake by the commotion, gripped a concealed weapon in her hands.</p> <p>&#8220;Enemy Attack!&#8221;</p> <p>Qin Yi wasted no time, with her sword in hand, she rushed out of the courtyard.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Boom!</p> <p>A deafening explosion shook the air.</p> <p>Qin Yi, having just reached the doorway, was thrown backward and sent flying into the room.</p> <p>In the moonlight, she saw a massive golden pestle crash into the ground in front of the door, leaving a web-like crater two meters wide.</p> <p>Creak&#8230;</p> <p>The sound of wood groaning came from overhead.</p> <p>The walls on either side of the door slowly collapsed, and the roof tilted dangerously.</p> <p>The golden pestle was lifted by someone, its golden rings clinking melodiously.</p> <p>&#8220;Amitabha&#8230; At last, this humble monk has found a second-grade assassin.&#8221;</p> <p>A burly monk, over two meters tall with kind-looking brows and eyes, squeezed into the room.</p> <p>Sniffing the air, he chuckled.</p> <p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; A second-grade female assassin. I wonder if you&#8217;re Yu Luosha or the Serpent Maiden?&#8221; The monk licked his lips, his expression turning lecherous. &#8220;Such fortune for this poor monk!&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing the lascivious monk holding the pestle, Qin Yi&#8217;s heart sank.</p> <p>&#8220;Wan Jin Hall&#8230; Qingyuan Hall Master!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>In Another Courtyard</p> <p>A blade as dark as ink flashed like lightning, beheading five Wan Jin Hall members in an instant.</p> <p>The five fell to the ground, their blood spurting three feet high.</p> <p>Huang San took a deep breath, inhaling the thick scent of blood, allowing the hot droplets to splatter across his face.</p> <p>His gaze grew colder.</p> <p>Two figures entered the courtyard.</p> <p>&#8220;Yun&#8217;er, this man is a second-grade martial artist. His skills are decent. Use him as your grindstone.&#8221; A calm, middle-aged voice broke the silence.</p> <p>Huang San turned toward the courtyard entrance, his face heavy with caution.</p> <p>Under the moonlight, two figures in white robes stood at the entrance.</p> <p>One was a scholarly man in his forties, casually rolling two steel balls that gleamed with a chilling light in his right hand.</p> <p>The balls clinked together, producing a rhythmic sound.</p> <p>Next to him stood a young man, handsome and in his twenties, bearing a striking resemblance to the older man.</p> <p>Unlike the elder, the young man gripped his pair of steel balls firmly, his stance steady.</p> <p>Gazing at the older man, Huang San slowly uttered six words:</p> <p>&#8220;Wan Jin Hall&#8230; Fire Dragon King!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>In a Southern Courtyard of the Village</p> <p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>A series of blood-curdling screams echoed through the night.</p> <p>The Wan Jin Hall members who had just broken into the house staggered back after a few pained wails.</p> <p>They barely took a few steps before collapsing to the ground, lifeless.</p> <p>In the moonlight, one could see two dark green puncture marks on their necks.</p> <p>Hearing the commotion, Tie Ying charged into the courtyard without hesitation, smashing through a side window of the house.</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>The wooden window shattered into splinters.</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s movement was like that of a ferocious eagle&#8212;wildly aggressive and utterly unstoppable!</p> <p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p> <p>In the darkness, the sound of something sharp slicing through the air echoed.</p> <p>Several venomous snakes, their bodies patterned with green, blue, and red stripes, lunged toward Tie Ying.</p> <p>With ruthless precision, he grabbed them midair and crushed their bodies with sheer force.</p> <p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;ll fight you to the death!&#8221;</p> <p>A sharp, anguished cry of a woman resounded within the room.</p> <p>It was Qian Qi, the Snake Maiden. She launched herself at Tie Ying, her eyes filled with despair and fury.</p> <p>Tie Ying sneered. &#8220;Good! Come at me!&#8221;</p> <p>His hands, like steel claws, reached for Qian Qi.</p> <p>In the next instant, a cloud of fine white powder was flung toward Tie Ying.</p> <p>Recognizing the scent, Tie Ying immediately channeled his internal energy into his hands, transforming his claws into open palms.</p> <p>With a powerful burst of wind from his palms, he dispersed the white powder.</p> <p>But by the time the powder had cleared, Qian Qi had vanished.</p> <p>&#8220;Lime! Shameless!&#8221; Tie Ying&#8217;s face turned ashen. Without wasting a moment, he activated his qinggong technique and dashed after her.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Whoosh!</p> <p>Several pillars of fire rose into the night sky, consuming the wooden roofs of the houses.</p> <p>Within moments, the flames engulfed entire homes, and the weakened structures groaned before collapsing with resounding crashes.</p> <p>Xiaofeng Village, home to fewer than a hundred households, had become a sea of flames.</p> <p>The entire village was ablaze.</p> <p>In the courtyards and along the village paths, martial artists were locked in fierce combat.</p> <p>Corpses littered the ground, their blood pooling into the dirt.</p> <p>&#8220;Die!&#8221;</p> <p>A thunderous roar pierced through the chaos as a massive purple-gold hammer smashed into a Wan Jin Hall member.</p> <p>The unfortunate man didn&#8217;t even have time to scream before the hammer, weighing over a hundred pounds, crushed him into pulp. His flesh and bones blended into a grotesque mess.</p> <p>Chen Er, wielding his dual purple-gold hammers, stood amidst a pile of mangled bodies.</p> <p>Further along the village path, another figure moved with agility. Though his frame was slender, his movements were quick and precise. He wielded an iron fan, weaving through the battlefield with effortless grace.</p> <p>The sharp tip of the iron fan struck silently, and every person it touched collapsed instantly, dead without a sound.</p> <p>After eliminating several third-grade martial artists together, Chen Er and Zhou Ba exchanged glances, seeing the gravity in each other&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230;&#8221; a faint sound reached their ears.</p> <p>Chen Er felt a chill down his spine&#8212;a foreboding sense of doom overwhelmed him.</p> <p>Panicked, he shifted his body, but he wasn&#8217;t fast enough.</p> <p>A shadow grazed his shoulder, leaving a deep cut. Blood began to pour from the wound.</p> <p>Zhou Ba&#8217;s hair stood on end as he reacted swiftly. His iron fan unfolded with a sharp snap, fluttering like a butterfly in the firelight.</p> <p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p> <p>The sound of projectiles deflecting off the fan rang out.</p> <p>A few dark objects fell to the ground, their tips gleaming with a ghostly green under the firelight.</p> <p>Recognizing them, Zhou Ba shouted in alarm: &#8220;Tang Clan!&#8221;</p> <p>Three martial artists clad in black nightclothes suddenly appeared atop the courtyard wall. In unison, six hands moved, unleashing a flurry of deadly glints that streaked through the air like lightning.</p> <p>TL Notes:</p> <p>Hour of the Pig: refers to the time period in the Chinese zodiac associated with the pig, typically considered to be between 9pm and 11pm at night</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>At the Last Moment, a figure suddenly leaped out from the side.</p> <p>The person held an unusual iron umbrella, landing in front of Chen Er and Zhou Ba. With a flick, the umbrella opened.</p> <p>The umbrella&#8217;s razor-sharp metal spokes spun rapidly, gleaming coldly under the moonlight.</p> <p>Ding! Ding! Ding!</p> <p>The projectiles launched by the three Tang Sect assassins were deflected, scattering harmlessly to the ground.</p> <p>The sight stunned the Tang Sect warriors.</p> <p>&#8220;The Deadly Umbrella&#8212;He Wu?&#8221;</p> <p>Zhou Ba instantly recognized the newcomer, and his face lit up with delight.</p> <p>&#8220;Save the chatter! Run! Xu Xiaolin is right behind me! Damn it, just my luck!&#8221; The killer wielding the iron umbrella cursed under his breath, snapped the umbrella shut, and sprinted.</p> <p>Chen Er and Zhou Ba exchanged a brief, stunned glance before quickly activating their qinggong techniques to follow He Wu.</p> <p>If they didn&#8217;t flee now, they&#8217;d truly be corpses in no time.</p> <p>The Tang Sect disciples were notorious for their prowess in battle, capable of defeating stronger opponents through cunning and skill.</p> <p>And here, there were three second-grade Tang Sect warriors.</p> <p>If they delayed any longer, they wouldn&#8217;t even know how they died.</p> <p>Just as the trio made their escape, a shadowy figure appeared silently on the path ahead.</p> <p>The man had a hunched back and walked quietly&#8212;it was none other than Xu Xiaolin, the leader of the Yuhu Hall.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin glanced briefly at the Tang Sect assassins but said nothing.</p> <p>As he was about to pursue, he suddenly froze in place.</p> <p>For a fleeting moment, he thought he saw a familiar silhouette.</p> <p>That brief pause was all it took for the three elite assassins of Fengyu Tower to disappear into the distance.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin quickly refocused, gathering internal energy into his legs, and pursued them with ghost-like speed.</p> <p>The three Tang Sect warriors in black exchanged wary glances.</p> <p>&#8220;Move! Don&#8217;t let Xu Xiaolin take advantage!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The Purple-Gold King was hit by my hidden weapon&#8212; it&#8217;s poisoned, they won&#8217;t get far!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;After them!&#8221;</p> <p>The three men launched into pursuit, their qinggong techniques allowing them to run just like dragonflies skimming across the water.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>In the mountains behind Xiaofeng Village</p> <p>Several lanterns hung on a bamboo house, illuminating the interior as they would under daylight.</p> <p>By the second-floor window, Eunuch Wang stood as he admired the fiery chaos engulfing Feng Village with screams echoing endlessly in the night.</p> <p>&#8220;Such a beautiful sight to behold!&#8221; Eunuch Wang&#8217;s sharp, high-pitched voice carried a hint of satisfaction.</p> <p>Behind him, seated cross-legged at a small tea table, Fengyu Tower Master remained silent, gazing at his now-cold tea. His expression was as calm as the murky brown of the tea itself.</p> <p>Eunuch Wang chuckled as he took in the destruction. &#8220;Wanjin Hall sent eight of their leaders&#8212;three first-grade, five second-grade. Fire Dragon King even brought his precious son along.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The Tang Sect also sent five elders and three direct disciples.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s seventeen experts of second grade or higher.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And over a hundred third-grade Wanjin Hall warriors.&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s pale, beardless face twisted into an intoxicated smile as the distant screams continued. It was as though the suffering of others brought him immense pleasure.</p> <p>&#8220;A killer organization that ruled the martial world for over a decade&#8212;destroyed in a single night. Witnessing this is truly a rare and marvelous treat!&#8221;</p> <p>The Tower Master lifted his cold tea and took a sip. His voice was calm as he said, &#8220;Eunuch Wang, why don&#8217;t you test the younger generation&#8217;s skills yourself?&#8221;</p> <p>Eunuch Wang chuckled, turning to face the Pavilion Master. &#8220;Your Highness, His Majesty&#8217;s orders are for me to watch over you. Don&#8217;t even think of retreating now. We&#8217;ve come too far. Even if you regret it now, it&#8217;s already too late.&#8221;</p> <p>His shrill tone carried a hint of schadenfreude.</p> <p>The Tower Master said nothing. He gently set down his teacup, his gaze fixed on the swirling tea inside.</p> <p>No one could tell what he was thinking.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Bang!</p> <p>Qin Yi&#8217;s sword flew from her grasp as she slammed into a wall, coughing up a mouthful of blood.</p> <p>The already crumbling house groaned under the impact, its structure on the verge of collapse.</p> <p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s hands danced through the air like a butterfly, sending Tang Sect hidden weapons flying toward a burly monk in the room.</p> <p>But the leader of Qingyuan Hall didn&#8217;t even bother dodging.</p> <p>The hidden weapons stopped an inch from his body, deflected by an invisible shield of energy, falling harmlessly to the ground.</p> <p>Seeing this, Xiao Lian&#8217;s eyes filled with frustration.</p> <p>She had recently advanced her internal energy to the foundational stage and her qinggong technique to mastery, finally qualifying as a third-grade warrior.</p> <p>But against this monk, she couldn&#8217;t even penetrate his protective energy field.</p> <p>The Qingyuan Hall leader hefted his staff, his earlier strike sending Qin Yi flying into a wall, coughing blood.</p> <p>The gap between first-grade warriors and second-grade warriors was immense.</p> <p>And Xiao Lian, with her third-grade skills, was no match at all.</p> <p>The monk turned to Xiao Lian after incapacitating Qin Yi.</p> <p>&#8220;A mere third grade?&#8221;</p> <p>He sniffed the air, his face lighting up with joy.</p> <p>&#8220;Not bad. A female assassin.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Fortune truly favors me.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Let me take a closer look at you.&#8221;</p> <p>As he spoke, the monk advanced, his staff in hand.</p> <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p> <p>Several black orbs flew toward him, but he didn&#8217;t bother dodging.</p> <p>The moment the orbs were about to hit, they exploded.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Black flames erupted in the air.</p> <p>Seizing the moment, Qin Yi sprang up, grabbed Xiao Lian, and dashed toward the window. Like a cat, she smashed through it and disappeared, moving with breathtaking speed.</p> <p>The Qingyuan Hall leader froze mid-step, his face darkening as he sniffed the air again.</p> <p>&#8220;Soft Bone Powder hidden inside explosives? From the Tang Sect?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Where did they get such wicked things!&#8221;</p> <p>At this time, the shaky village house could no longer support itself.</p> <p>Boom!&#160;</p> <p>The house buried the Qingyuan Hall leader beneath its rubble.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>In a quiet courtyard, Huang San stood still, a bead of sweat trickling down his forehead.</p> <p>The droplet slid down his nose, quivering at the tip but refusing to fall.</p> <p>It itched unbearably, but Huang San didn&#8217;t dare move. His gaze was fixed on the two people in front of him&#8212;more specifically, the younger one.</p> <p>Clad in white, with a tightly gripped steel ball in his hand, Master Huoyun also had sweat glistening on his brow.</p> <p>To them, the world seemed to vanish, leaving only their opponent.</p> <p>The shouts of battle, crackling flames, and agonized screams were distant noises that couldn&#8217;t disturb their focus.</p> <p>Though the standoff had lasted only a few minutes, it felt like hours.</p> <p>Beside Master Huoyun stood the Fire Dragon Hall Master, casually twirling an iron sphere in his hand, as though waiting for the duel to conclude.</p> <p>Shriek!</p> <p>A sharp whistle tore through the night, piercing the chaos.</p> <p>Huang San suddenly sprang into action.</p> <p>The handsome, steel-ball-wielding Master Huoyun moved as well.</p> <p>Huang San leaped gracefully, as light as a feather, stepping on the courtyard wall in a single bound.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>Mid-air, his body shuddered, as though struck by something.</p> <p>Ignoring the pain, he used his qinggong technique to vanish into the night.</p> <p>At the courtyard gate, the Fire Dragon King stopped spinning his steel balls and said lightly, &#8220;You were too hasty.&#8221;</p> <p>Master Huoyun bowed his head. &#8220;Yes, Father, I was impatient.&#8221;</p> <p>His right hand, which had been tightly clutching two steel balls, now held only one.</p> <p>No one saw when he threw the other.</p> <p>"If he hadn't been solely focused on escaping, you'd already be dead by his blade," Fire Dragon King said in an even tone.</p> <p>Hearing this evaluation from his father, Master Huoyun felt a chill in his heart.</p> <p>"Go back, shut yourself away for three months, and keep training," Fire Dragon King instructed indifferently.</p> <p>He began walking slowly in the direction where Huang San had fled.</p> <p>Master Huoyun gave a bitter smile, shook his head, and turned to leave in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Huang San was a peak second-grade martial artist, a formidable opponent.</p> <p>Master Huoyun knew he still had a long way to go.</p> <p>Huang San vaulted over the wall and dared not linger even for a moment.</p> <p>He gritted his teeth as cold sweat drenched his forehead, his face pale.</p> <p>His left shoulder was a bloody mess, the flesh torn apart. His left arm hung limp as if it were broken, swinging with every movement he made.</p> <p>He ran swiftly toward a specific direction, his feet barely touching the ground.</p> <p>It was fortunate, he thought, that the attack came from Fire Dragon King's son, whose skills with the steel ball were still unrefined.</p> <p>Huang San felt a momentary sense of luck.</p> <p>If it had been Fire Dragon King himself, the damage would not have been limited to his shoulder but would likely have cost him his head.</p> <p>Clenching his teeth, Huang San's mind replayed past conversations with Steward Huang and Qin Yi's deductions.</p> <p>A wry smile tugged at his lips. At last, he understood.</p> <p>Everyone is betraying Fengyu Tower&#8230;</p> <p>This thought included even the master of the Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>As Huang San raced toward his destination, voices carried over from not far away.</p> <p>"Zhou Ba, put me down. I've already been poisoned. Let me go back and kill a few more&#8212;can't let it be a total loss!" The gruff, hoarse voice of Chen Er was tinged with fatigue.</p> <p>"Enough already. Poisoned by the Tang Sect, You think you can still fight? Can you even stand?" came a disdainful reply in a slightly unfamiliar voice.</p> <p>Huang San strained to listen and picked up his pace, quickly approaching.</p> <p>When Chen Er, Zhou Ba, and He Wu saw him, they instinctively prepared to attack.</p> <p>Upon recognizing Huang San, they all paused, exclaiming in unison, "Huang San, what happened to your arm?"</p> <p>Huang San, his face dripping with sweat, responded through gritted teeth, "It was the Fire Dragon King. He used me as a sharpening stone for his son."</p> <p>The three exchanged glances and immediately quickened their pace.</p> <p>"Huang San, keep your distance from us!"</p> <p>"Fire Dragon King? Zhou Ba, run faster!"</p> <p>"Terrible luck."</p> <p>Huang San: "..."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>&#8220;Cri!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Cri!&#8221;</p> <p>Sharp whistles pierced the air, echoing around the village.</p> <p>Silently and without a sound, Xu Xiaolin followed behind Zhou Ba and his companions, not in a hurry to kill them.</p> <p>As he crossed half the village, Xu Xiaolin noticed something unusual.</p> <p>The piercing whistles came one after another, increasing in number. More and more assassins blew strange signals with their whistles.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin slowed his pace, letting the three Tang Sect disciples trailing him catch up.</p> <p>The three disciples didn&#8217;t hesitate; they quickened their pace to pursue Zhou Ba and the others.</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin leapt onto the roof of a house, scanning his surroundings. He noticed that the assassins from Fengyu Tower were all fleeing in the same direction, as if they had prearranged their movements.</p> <p>Narrowing his eyes slightly, Xu Xiaolin counted the assassins fleeing.</p> <p>There were fewer than ten second-grade experts left.</p> <p>The rest had been slain in the combined assault by the Wan Jin Hall Masters and the Tang Sect elders.</p> <p>As for the third-grade silver-ranked assassins, a great number of them had fallen as well.</p> <p>&#8220;Running east? What&#8217;s over there? A forest?&#8221; Xu Xiaolin muttered to himself as he observed the assassins&#8217; escape route.</p> <p>&#8220;Trying to break through? How laughable&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin sneered, having roughly guessed the assassins&#8217; intentions.</p> <p>Since Wan Jin Hall and the Tang Sect had made their move, they wouldn&#8217;t leave anyone from Fengyu Tower alive.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>On the village road, engulfed in flames:</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!&#8221;</p> <p>The sound of hidden weapons tearing through the air echoed.</p> <p>The Wan Jin Hall followers rushing in from all directions clutched their eyes or throats, letting out screams of agony.</p> <p>Xiao Lian supported Qin Yi with one hand, while her other hand flung a handful of hidden weapons at the approaching enemies.</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Lian, head east. The whistle signals mean to go east,&#8221; Qin Yi said, half-leaning against Xiao Lian&#8217;s shoulder. Her face was pale, blood dripping from the corner of her lips.</p> <p>Taking a direct blow from the Qingyuan Hall Master had left her severely injured.</p> <p>The gap between first- and second-grade martial artists was already vast. Moreover, the Qingyuan Hall Master was innately powerful, wielding Shaolin inner strength that was both overwhelming and righteous&#8212;specifically countering yin and cold-based martial arts.</p> <p>Had he not held back, Qin Yi would already be dead. Of course, his restraint wasn&#8217;t without ulterior motives&#8230;</p> <p>Xiao Lian bit her lip as she looked at the burning village. Gathering her limited inner strength, she performed the Drifting Rain Footwork, heading east.</p> <p>Fortunately, she and Qin Yi&#8217;s lodging was already near the village&#8217;s eastern edge.</p> <p>The eastern village exit wasn&#8217;t far.</p> <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that Qin Yi?&#8221;</p> <p>A man&#8217;s unfamiliar voice called out from not far behind Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Xiao Lian launched her hidden weapons.</p> <p>&#8220;Ding! Ding! Ding!&#8221;</p> <p>A series of crisp sounds rang out as her projectiles were deflected.</p> <p>&#8220;Tang Sect?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;He Wu, she&#8217;s Qin Yi&#8217;s disciple.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Heh! Interesting. She&#8217;s pretty skilled with Tang Sect techniques.&#8221;</p> <p>The voices behind her grew closer.</p> <p>Xiao Lian recognized Zhou Ba&#8217;s voice among them.</p> <p>Without stopping, she glanced back slightly, seeing Zhou Ba carrying Chen Er. Chen Er&#8217;s lips were a sickly blue, his consciousness fading as black blood oozed from his shoulder&#8212;a clear sign of poisoning.</p> <p>Next to Zhou Ba were Huang San and a man wielding a strange iron umbrella.</p> <p>Huang San caught up with Xiao Lian, noticing Qin Yi&#8217;s pale face. He quickly asked, &#8220;Who hurt you?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Monk Qingyuan,&#8221; Qin Yi replied faintly, her voice barely above a whisper.</p> <p>The others exchanged strange looks.</p> <p>The assassin named He Wu cursed under his breath, &#8220;Damn it.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I should never have run with you lot. Look at who&#8217;s chasing us&#8212;Xu Xiaolin, three Tang Sect disciples, Fire Dragon King, and now Monk Qingyuan!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;How many first-grade experts does Wan Jin Hall even have?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ve got two right on our heels!&#8221;</p> <p>A heavy silence fell over the group.</p> <p>They all knew they couldn&#8217;t outrun their pursuers.</p> <p>At this rate, death was inevitable.</p> <p>Just then&#8212;</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>A fierce gust of wind swept toward them from behind.</p> <p>A chill ran down everyone&#8217;s spine.</p> <p>Huang San grabbed Xiao Lian and forcefully leapt to the side.</p> <p>Zhou Ba and He Wu also used all their strength to dodge to the side.</p> <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;</p> <p>A deafening explosion rang out.</p> <p>The ground of the village road cracked, dirt flying everywhere.</p> <p>An unstoppable force surged forth.</p> <p>Huang San, Zhou Ba, and He Wu were all knocked to the ground by the shockwave.</p> <p>In front of them now stood a three-meter-tall Demon-Subduing Vajra Staff.</p> <p>The staff was deeply embedded in the ground, its golden rings shaking violently, emitting a clear and resonant sound akin to the chant of a Buddha.</p> <p>&#8220;Amitabha. Did this poor monk ever say you could leave?&#8221;</p> <p>A towering monk clad in yellow robes stepped onto the road.</p> <p>Standing over two meters tall and monstrously muscular, he wore a lecherous smirk as his gaze roved over Qin Yi and Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Not far from the monk, a flash of white appeared.</p> <p>A middle-aged man dressed in white, holding two iron balls, emerged.</p> <p>The steel balls clinked together with a chilling &#8220;click-clack&#8221; sound.</p> <p>Fire Dragon King looked coldly at the remaining second-grade assassins, his gaze devoid of emotion, as if staring at ants.</p> <p>Meanwhile, three figures leapt down from the rooftops.</p> <p>Dressed in identical black nightwear and masks, they were the three Tang Sect disciples.</p> <p>Upon seeing Monk Qingyuan and Fire Dragon King, their bodies tensed.</p> <p>Two of them, judging by their exposed eyes, were women.</p> <p>The fear and dread in their gazes as they looked at Monk Qingyuan made it clear&#8212;his reputation was truly vile.</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>The sound of light footsteps came again.</p> <p>From the southern courtyard wall, a nimble young girl leapt out, her face flushed, as if fleeing a pursuer.</p> <p>Qian Qi landed on the dirt road at the village entrance and froze at the sight of Monk Qingyuan, Fire Dragon King, and the Tang Sect disciples.</p> <p>Cold sweat beaded her fair forehead.</p> <p>&#8220;Shameless! Where are you going?&#8221;</p> <p>Suddenly, the courtyard wall behind her exploded, and a burly, thick-browed man charged out.</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s head was covered in dust, his face ashen.</p> <p>He broke through the mud wall, and upon seeing the scene before him, couldn&#8217;t help but laugh.</p> <p>&#8220;Run, huh? Weren&#8217;t you so good at running?&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San, Zhou Ba, He Wu, and the others climbed to their feet, their faces dark as they stared at the enemies surrounding them.</p> <p>Xiao Lian supported Qin Yi, biting her lip tightly, her eyes filled with unwillingness.</p> <p>The difference in strength between them and their enemies was insurmountable. Escape was impossible.</p> <p>Was it really going to end like this?</p> <p>A trace of sorrow appeared in Xiao Lian&#8217;s eyes. She had journeyed all the way from Jianing Prefecture to Lin&#8217;an Prefecture.</p> <p>She had finally learned martial arts, yet hadn&#8217;t even had the chance to kill that person.</p> <p>Was she going to die now?</p> <p>At that moment, her mind first conjured the face of the one she hated most, but it slowly shifted into another visage.</p> <p>That person had a handsome face, always accompanied by a gentle smile.</p> <p>Director...</p> <p>I&#8217;ve broken my promise.</p> <p>I can&#8217;t go back anymore.</p> <p>Xiao Lian pressed her lips tightly together, her once-bright eyes now dull and lifeless.</p> <p>Faced with impending death, a faint bitterness welled up in her heart.</p> <p>He Wu, leaning on his iron umbrella, blood staining the corner of his mouth, shouted angrily, &#8220;Wan Jin Hall! Acting like this&#8212;aren&#8217;t you afraid of retaliation from our Tower Master?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Your Tower Master?&#8221;</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan&#8217;s face twisted into an odd smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid your Tower Master can&#8217;t even save himself right now. He doesn&#8217;t have time to bother with you!&#8221;</p> <p>As he finished speaking, Monk Qingyuan&#8217;s gaze slithered like a venomous snake over Qin Yi, Xiao Lian, and Qian Qi.</p> <p>&#8220;Three female assassins&#8212;nice figures, all of them!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;These three are mine. None of you are allowed to touch them,&#8221; he declared with an air of finality.</p> <p>His fiery gaze lingered as he extended his tongue, licking his lips.</p> <p>At that moment, his lecherous expression was utterly at odds with his monk&#8217;s robes.</p> <p>If the Buddha were present, he would likely strike Qingyuan down with a wrathful blow for defiling his teachings.</p> <p>No one else said a word; they all knew Monk Qingyuan&#8217;s temperament.</p> <p>Any woman he set his sights on was as good as dead.</p> <p>Qin Yi&#8217;s face turned pale, her voice laced with deep regret as she whispered to Xiao Lian, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ve dragged you into this.&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian shook her head. &#8220;Master, it was my own choice.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;If there&#8217;s blame, it lies with the whims of fate.&#8221;</p> <p>The flames continued to rage throughout the village.</p> <p>The firelight illuminated Xiao Lian&#8217;s delicate features, lending her an ethereal beauty.</p> <p>But in her eyes, a resolute determination began to burn.</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan&#8217;s expression had already told her what fate awaited if she survived.</p> <p>&#8220;Better to die,&#8221; she thought, the resolve in her heart growing stronger.</p> <p>&#8220;Ah...&#8221;</p> <p>Just then, a soft sigh suddenly echoed.</p> <p>The sound was so abrupt, as if it had come out of nowhere.</p> <p>Everyone present froze, startled by the unexpected voice.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>In the village engulfed in the flames of battle, a figure suddenly appeared on the narrow path.
</p> <p>He wore a simple yellow hemp shirt and a red mask with white patterns.
</p> <p>Hearing the soft sigh, everyone present turned to look at the figure.
</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s eyes lit up when he saw the man, and he laughed. &#8220;Brother Hua? You&#8217;re here to join the fun too?&#8221;
</p> <p>Tie Ying vividly remembered this young man who had managed to block his Eagle Claw earlier.
</p> <p>Chen Ye said nothing. Instead, he reached into his robe and pulled out a silver mask with a leaf motif engraved on its edges.
</p> <p>In the next instant&#8212;
</p> <p>The figure on the village path vanished. All that remained was the red mask with white patterns, which fell to the ground with a soft &#8220;plop.&#8221;
</p> <p>At the same time, a calm and gentle voice rang out from behind the Wanjin Hall group.
</p> <p>&#8220;Come back with me.&#8221;
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan, Fire Dragon King, Tie Ying, and the three Tang Sect disciples all turned their heads in unison.
</p> <p>Their faces twisted in shock as they locked onto the yellow-robed figure now standing in the midst of the Fengyu Tower assassins.
</p> <p>The mask on the man&#8217;s face had turned silver, its edges adorned with the leaf motif.
</p> <p>Chen Ye gently reached out and ruffled Xiao Lian&#8217;s hair.
</p> <p>The assassins from Fengyu Tower stared at the masked man who had suddenly appeared among them. Their hearts pounded, and their pupils contracted.
</p> <p>So fast!
</p> <p>Such terrifying speed!
</p> <p>If this man had come with murderous intent, they would already be dead!
</p> <p>Xiao Lian froze, feeling the warmth of his touch on her head.
</p> <p>Then, she heard that familiar, gentle voice&#8212;filled with joy and disbelief.
</p> <p>&#8220;D-Director?&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled faintly and patted her head.
</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s eyes were wide as saucers as he stared at the masked man who had appeared so effortlessly in the center of the Fengyu Tower assassins. His jaw dropped, his face a picture of utter astonishment.
</p> <p>&#8220;Hua Dong&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Dong Hua&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s it!&#8221;
</p> <p>He murmured to himself, his expression a mix of realization and shock.
</p> <p>So Hua Dong was Dong Hua all along!
</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s expression turned awkward.
</p> <p>Earlier that afternoon, he had been bragging endlessly to &#8220;Hua Dong.&#8221;
</p> <p>Now Tie Ying wished he could find a hole to crawl into and hide.
</p> <p>The others present, hearing Tie Ying&#8217;s words, also realized the identity of the yellow-robed masked man.
</p> <p>&#8220;Dong Hua?&#8221;
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan slightly squinted his eyes, his expression retracting into a serious one.
</p> <p>Fire Dragon King also directed his gaze towards Chen Ye, his eyes deep and thoughtful.
</p> <p>The steel ball that had been constantly twirling in his right hand suddenly came to a stop.
</p> <p>The three Tang Sect disciples looked at Chen Ye with curiosity.
</p> <p>Was this the Dong Hua of the trial? Wasn&#8217;t he out of worldly affairs?
Why was he here?
</p> <p>With Chen Ye's appearance, the atmosphere in the area strangely quieted.
</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230; Whoosh&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>The sound of light footsteps echoed from behind the Wanjin Hall group.
</p> <p>The other hall masters and five Tang Sect elders had already killed off the remaining second-grade assassins and had arrived at the scene.
</p> <p>A middle-aged man dressed as a wealthy merchant, his face adorned with a smile, gracefully landed next to Monk Qingyuan and Fire Dragon King, using qinggong.
</p> <p>On his right thumb, he wore a ruby ring, which he slowly rubbed.
</p> <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;
</p> <p>The wealthy merchant looked at the injured assassins with a grin, his gaze briefly lingering on Chen Ye.
</p> <p>When no one responded, the wealthy merchant turned his attention to Tie Ying. &#8220;Xiao Ying, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;
</p> <p>Tie Ying&#8217;s mouth twitched, and he gritted his teeth, speaking through clenched jaws, &#8220;Hall Master Jin, that man is Dong Hua.&#8221;
</p> <p>The middle-aged merchant narrowed his eyes slightly, a trace of caution flickering in his gaze.
</p> <p>He was the Hall Master of Wanjin Hall's Jinchan Hall, a first-grade martial artist himself.
</p> <p>&#8220;Dong Hua?&#8221;
</p> <p>The newly arrived hall master and Tang Sect elders turned to look at Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, upon seeing Chen Ye, showed a look of surprise.
</p> <p>It was him.
</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin remembered the ghost-like agility of Dong Hua&#8217;s light body technique when they had encountered each other outside of Jiangning City.
</p> <p>Chen Ye, dressed in yellow, with a tall and slender figure, and a silver leaf-patterned mask on his face, stood calmly at the center of the crowd.
</p> <p>At that moment, a cold mechanical voice rang in Chen Ye's ears.
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Daily settlement initiated!]
</p> <p>&#8220;Skip.&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye silently thought to himself.
</p> <p>Now was not the time for the daily settlement.
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Total points earned: 105]
</p> <p>[Remaining points: 4077]
</p> <p>A phantom blue light screen popped up in front of Chen Ye&#8217;s eyes.
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Xiao Lian&#8217;s gratitude level has increased!]
</p> <p>[Current gratitude level: 85%]
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Congratulations! You have obtained one opportunity for the Director's skill draw!]
</p> <p>A trace of surprise flashed in Chen Ye's eyes.
</p> <p>It had reached 85%!
</p> <p>Without hesitation, he silently thought, &#8220;System, draw the skill!&#8221;
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Skill draw in progress...]
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>&#8220;Crack, crack&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;
</p> <p>The sound of buildings collapsing and burning echoed around the village.
</p> <p>The air was thick with the stench of blood and the smell of charred bodies.
</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s him!&#8221;
</p> <p>Qin Yi's face turned pale as she whispered to herself.
</p> <p>She recognized the ghostly agility of Chen Ye&#8217;s movements, recalling the night she had spoken with Xiao Lian in Yuhang County.
</p> <p>There had been a person who appeared then.
</p> <p>His movements were like that of a ghost.
</p> <p>Other assassins also turned their attention to Chen Ye, their eyes filled with concern and uncertainty.
</p> <p>No one knew what Dong Hua was here for.
</p> <p>The hall master of Wanjin Hall and the Tang Sect elders remained silent.
</p> <p>They merely watched Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Anyone who could be considered a peer of Qing Xuzi was certainly no simple figure!
</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t speak. He stared at the phantom blue light screen before him.
</p> <p>[Ding!]
</p> <p>[Congratulations, host! You have drawn the skill: Origin of Qi Body]
</p> <p>[Origin of Qi Body: The body is filled with innate Qi, boundless and endless, and can be used as internal strength.]
</p> <p>At the moment the skill was drawn&#8212;
</p> <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;

                            </p><p>Monk Qingyuan's body swelled up like an inflated balloon, his eyeballs bulging as the skin on his face trembled.
</p> <p>In less than a breath, a tremendous explosion rang out.
</p> <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan exploded suddenly, blood and flesh splattering everywhere.
</p> <p>Chen Ye's protective aura instinctively blocked the blood and flesh, and his yellow robe remained clean and neat.
</p> <p>Even Xiao Lian and the others standing beside him were untouched by a single drop of blood.
</p> <p>Looking at the splattered pieces of flesh, Chen Ye fell into silence.
</p> <p>He only wanted to test the innate Qi in his body.
</p> <p>He never expected that just a few moments after the transfer, he would have exploded Monk Qingyuan.</p> <p>The newly drawn skill was too powerful!
</p> <p>It wasn&#8217;t just Chen Ye who was silent.
</p> <p>The remaining seven hall masters of Wan Jin Hall, as well as the five elders and three direct disciples of the Tang Sect, were all stunned.
</p> <p>Exploded...?
</p> <p>Everyone present was frozen in shock.
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan came from the Shaolin Temple and possessed the deepest inner power, known for its extreme yang and unyielding strength.
</p> <p>He was a late-stage first-grade master.
</p> <p>And yet, he had been blown apart by Dong Hua in just a few breaths?
</p> <p>The Hall Master of Jinchan Hall, a middle-aged merchant with a ruby ring on his thumb, swallowed hard, his eyes glazed, lips trembling.
</p> <p>He couldn&#8217;t believe what he was seeing.
</p> <p>Usually, when martial artists compete in internal strength, the worst that could happen is that one suffers from the backlash, severely damaging their vitality.
</p> <p>But this... How could anyone explode a person like this?
</p> <p>The level of inner strength required for this was unimaginable!
</p> <p>Is this even something a human can do?
</p> <p>Fire Dragon King stood frozen, no longer the calm, indifferent figure who once looked down on the world.
</p> <p>He stared at the exploded pieces of Monk Qingyuan, feeling his mouth dry.
</p> <p>The remaining two first-grade masters in the room didn&#8217;t dare to move either.
</p> <p>To an outsider, it might have seemed like a spectacle, but to an insider, they saw the profound terror.
</p> <p>Dong Hua had used his internal strength to literally explode a late-stage first-grade master known for his internal power!
</p> <p>The two first-grade martial artists shared the same thought at that moment.
</p> <p>Dong Hua is a Grandmaster!!!
</p> <p>The remaining second-grade hall masters, Tang Sect elders, and disciples all looked at Chen Ye with fear and awe.
</p> <p>The scene just now had been too shocking for them to process.
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan killed second-grade assassins like killing dogs.
</p> <p>Yet, this mysterious Dong Hua had wiped him out in two moves, leaving nothing, not even bones!
</p> <p>Tie Ying's gaze fell on the blood and flesh strewn across the ground, his mouth twitching.
</p> <p>Didn&#8217;t he just call Dong Hua "bro" earlier?
</p> <p>Tie Ying's expression suddenly turned into a complex one.
</p> <p>Xu Xiaolin, too, wore an expression of horror, not expecting Dong Hua to possess such power!
</p> <p>He couldn&#8217;t help but feel incredibly relieved that he hadn&#8217;t clashed with Dong Hua that day.
</p> <p>If he had, he might be dead by now.
</p> <p>&#8220;Director...&#8221;
</p> <p>Xiao Lian stared dazedly at the figure before her, dressed in yellow with a silver mask.
</p> <p>No one was more shocked than her.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian had fought with Monk Qingyuan before, and to her, he seemed like an unbeatable demon.
</p> <p>Yet, he had been easily killed by Chen Ye!
</p> <p>Was this still the same Chen Ye who had lived with her for two months, always basking in the sun, reading books with a gentle smile on his face?
</p> <p>Xiao Lian gazed at Chen Ye&#8217;s figure, which seemed as deep as a vast abyss, filled with admiration in her eyes.
</p> <p>Director...
</p> <p>He&#8217;s amazing!
</p> <p>The assassins of Fengyu Tower behind Chen Ye gaped in disbelief.
</p> <p>They had thought they were doomed, but suddenly, a miracle appeared!
</p> <p>For a moment, the whole place fell silent.
</p> <p>Chen Ye shook off his surprise from the earlier moment.
</p> <p>His eyes swept over the Wan Jin Hall group with indifference.
</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye casually waved his sleeve.
</p> <p>A formless wave of force followed the motion of his sleeve, stirring the air.
</p> <p>A gust of wind erupted, causing sand and stones to fly.
</p> <p>The Wan Jin Hall members instinctively squinted and covered their faces with their sleeves to shield themselves from the dust.
</p> <p>They were filled with dread, unsure of what Dong Hua intended to do next.
</p> <p>When the wind settled, a horizontal line about two yards long appeared on the ground.
</p> <p>The line dug deep into the earth, revealing moist soil beneath.
</p> <p>Chen Ye observed the result of his movement and furrowed his brow.
</p> <p>There was too much innate Qi in his body; he still couldn&#8217;t control it freely.
</p> <p>He had only intended to draw a line on the ground with his internal strength, but instead, it had stirred up a wild gust of wind.
</p> <p>It could only be said that the skills the system gave were too strong.
</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze remained calm as he looked toward the Wan Jin Hall group, speaking softly.
</p> <p>&#8220;Those who cross the line.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Die.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>East of Xiaofeng Village, in the Forest
</p> <p>Tian Jizi leaned against a tree, pulling three copper coins from his chest. He held them in his hands and gently shook them a few times.
</p> <p>The coins fell to the ground, and he reached down to trace the patterns on them.
</p> <p>As the six lines completed, Tian Jizi interpreted the divination and murmured, &#8220;As expected, the second opportunity is here.&#8221;
</p> <p>A complex expression appeared on his face.
</p> <p>It seemed that the next thing he had to face would be something quite difficult for him.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>Tian Jizi sighed deeply, then slowly rose, holding a bamboo staff, and began walking westward.
</p> <p>&#8220;I missed the first opportunity; I can&#8217;t miss this one.&#8221;
</p> <p>He sighed again.
</p> <p>His fate was different from that of ordinary people. Ordinary people had three chances in life.
</p> <p>He only had two.
</p> <p>But if he grasped even one of them, the second half of his life would be as glorious as the fifth line of the Hexagram&#8212;&#8220;The Flying Dragon in the Sky.&#8221;
</p> <p>Wide and vast, free to roam!
</p> <p>It couldn&#8217;t get any better than that.
</p> <p>He had missed the opportunity on July 4th.
</p> <p>This time, he couldn&#8217;t afford to miss it.
</p> <p>However, the second opportunity&#8230;
</p> <p>The mere thought of what he was about to face made Tian Jizi&#8217;s lips curl into a bitter smile.
</p> <p>Some things had to have a result.
</p> <p>Some people had to face their fate.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi held his bamboo staff and continued walking slowly.
</p> <p>After a while, he suddenly stopped, sensing something.
</p> <p>He tilted his head, listening to the crackling sounds of firewood breaking.
</p> <p>Quickly, he performed a divination and reached a conclusion.
</p> <p>&#8220;A fork in the road?&#8221;
</p> <p>After interpreting the divination, Tian Jizi hesitated.
</p> <p>Ahead of him was a fork in the road.
</p> <p>One path led west, toward the eastern entrance of Xiaofeng Village.
</p> <p>The other path led north, toward the bamboo forest in the back mountains.
</p> <p>He stood in the middle of the fork.
</p> <p>&#8220;Strange, why do I have this feeling?&#8221; Tian Jizi murmured softly.
</p> <p>After a moment of thought, he couldn&#8217;t figure it out.
</p> <p>He shook his head and continued walking north.
</p> <p>His slender figure moved steadily along the country path, his steps unhurried but firm.
</p> <p>&#8220;Rustle&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>After walking for a bit, Tian Jizi stepped on some dry bamboo leaves.
</p> <p>He entered a bamboo forest.
</p> <p>Just then, someone grabbed his hand.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi&#8217;s body trembled, and he was about to make a move.
</p> <p>The hand that grabbed him opened up, writing a few strokes in the palm of his hand.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi took a deep breath, his face showing a complex expression.
</p> <p>He nodded and said, "Take me to see him..."
</p> <p>The hand lightly patted Tian Jizi&#8217;s shoulder, lifting his bamboo staff and leading him in a direction.
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>Second Floor of the Bamboo Pavilion
</p> <p>Eunuch Wang sat in a bamboo chair, looking relaxed.
</p> <p>This was the first time in the fourteen days since he had arrived at the Bamboo Loft that he had sat in the bamboo chair.
</p> <p>Not only was he sitting in the chair, but there was also a cup of tea in front of him.
</p> <p>It was a cup of tea with a bright green color, giving off a faint fragrance&#8212;high-quality tea.
</p> <p>Anyone who knew their tea would recognize it as the valuable pre-Qingming Longjing, the finest of West Lake Longjing.
</p> <p>Eunuch Wang picked up the cup, took a sip, closed his eyes, and carefully savored the pre-Qingming Longjing that the Marquis of Su had mentioned.
</p> <p>The warm tea entered his mouth, its taste sweet, smooth, and fragrant.
</p> <p>He opened his eyes and a faint smile appeared on his smooth, beardless face.
</p> <p>"Good tea, indeed, it&#8217;s really good tea!"
</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower sat across from Eunuch Wang, his stern face expressionless.
</p> <p>Behind Eunuch Wang, there stood twelve people.
</p> <p>There were both men and women, old and young.
</p> <p>They stood respectfully, as though waiting for something.
</p> <p>"Lord Marquis of Su, you should drink as well," Grand Eunuch Wang said, his voice sharp and thin, holding the tea cup.
</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower smiled faintly but did not speak.
</p> <p>"Click clack..."
</p> <p>Footsteps sounded from the stairs.
</p> <p>Eunuch Wang turned his head.
</p> <p>He saw the mute old man from earlier, leading a young blind boy up the stairs.</p> <p>The mute old man had graying hair and a cheerful smile on his face.
</p> <p>Behind the old man, the blind boy had a black cloth wrapped around his eyes, and he too was smiling, but his smile was forced, stiff.
</p> <p>It was as if the smile didn&#8217;t come naturally to him.
</p> <p>He was smiling under duress.
</p> <p>When the two of them arrived at the top, the Master of Fengyu Tower suddenly looked at the blind boy.
</p> <p>He stared at the boy&#8217;s face, looking and looking again.
</p> <p>Slowly, the Master of Fengyu Tower&#8217;s gaze softened, became approving, and then turned relaxed.
</p> <p>In just a few moments, his expression shifted several times.
</p> <p>Eunuch Wang&#8217;s expression changed.
</p> <p>He solemnly set down his tea cup, a flicker of shock passing through his eyes.
</p> <p>He had seen the change in the Marquis of Su&#8217;s gaze, every shift, clearly.
</p> <p>That kind of look, he had seen it before.
</p> <p>Eunuch Wang knew what that look meant.
</p> <p>His body suddenly shuddered, and he felt a chill run through his limbs.
</p> <p>A deep sense of horror filled his heart!
</p> <p>Because that gaze...
</p> <p>It was the kind of gaze a father gives to his son.

                            </p><p>The Marquis of Su was still alive, though he had lost his ability to father children.
</p> <p>This was not a secret in the Great Wu Dynasty, but rather an open secret.
</p> <p>Grand Eunuch Wang happened to know this secret.
</p> <p>It was precisely because he knew this secret that Grand Eunuch Wang felt a shiver of fear. Because, when the facts differ from what you know, it means something unexpected has occurred.
</p> <p>"You&#8217;ve come."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower suddenly spoke, his tone carrying a hint of joy.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi forced a bitter smile, his voice youthful as he replied, "I didn&#8217;t want to come."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower nodded, "But you had no choice. You had to come."
</p> <p>Tian Jizi nodded, his expression complicated.
</p> <p>He had missed the first opportunity.
</p> <p>Now, he had no choice but to be here.
</p> <p>"Some things need a conclusion," Tian Jizi said, his voice tinged with bitterness.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower nodded, then turned his gaze to the twelve people standing behind Grand Eunuch Wang.
</p> <p>"The twelve Earthly Branches, one Heavenly Stem."
</p> <p>"I&#8217;ve spent over a decade setting up this Jianghu, and from now on, they will all be yours."
</p> <p>The twelve behind Grand Eunuch Wang, as well as the old man who had brought Tian Jizi upstairs, all grinned.
</p> <p>None of them had tongues.
</p> <p>Yet, they smiled with squinted eyes, their faces full of happiness.
</p> <p>The way they looked at Tian Jizi carried a certain gleam.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi, with his eyes wrapped in black cloth, could not see it.
</p> <p>But he could feel it.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi opened his mouth, his voice hoarse as he said, "In a few years, Fengyu Tower will become the top power in the Jianghu."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower nodded in agreement.
</p> <p>A gentle smile appeared on his stern face.
</p> <p>"But even if Fengyu Tower grows, it will still only be a force in the Jianghu. Some things require a longer vision."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower picked up a purple clay teapot and retrieved a new cup from a small tea table.
</p> <p>Steaming tea poured from the spout.
</p> <p>"Fengyu Tower is too conspicuous. I&#8217;ll destroy it, and only then can it be reborn in a new form. Originally, I had planned to leave a few good candidates for you, with opportunities to rise to the top in a few years. But unfortunately, they were too clever and too foolish."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower picked up the tea cup, filled 3 quarters, and walked over to Tian Jizi, taking his hand and placing the cup into his palm.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi held the tea cup, but did not drink.
</p> <p>His expression was bitter, complex, and he muttered, "After tonight, Fengyu Tower will cease to exist."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower gently patted Tian Jizi&#8217;s shoulder, his eyes filled with some approval.
</p> <p>Then, he walked over to Grand Eunuch Wang.
</p> <p>At this moment, Grand Eunuch Wang&#8217;s face was pale, his body trembling.
</p> <p>His eyes were vacant, staring blankly at the tea table, his voice raspy, "I&#8217;m finished."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower nodded, "You&#8217;re finished." He sighed, "From the moment you walked into the Bamboo Loft, you were already dead."
</p> <p>Grand Eunuch Wang nodded in a daze.
</p> <p>"Anyone who saw or heard what just happened wouldn&#8217;t survive."
</p> <p>"But I am at the peak of the first rank. You may not be able to kill me." Grand Eunuch Wang still sat in the bamboo chair, but his face remained pale.
</p> <p>The earlier words did not give him any confidence.
</p> <p>Because he knew in his heart that the Marquis of Su knew he was at the peak of the first rank, yet had still revealed those secrets to him.
</p> <p>He probably really was doomed.
</p> <p>"Yes, you are at the peak of the first rank," the Lord of Fengyu Tower said, placing his hand lightly on Grand Eunuch Wang&#8217;s shoulder. "But it&#8217;s still not enough."
</p> <p>Feeling the weight of the hand on his shoulder, Grand Eunuch Wang smiled. It was a horrible smile.
</p> <p>"Go ahead and end it." The Lord of Fengyu Tower said calmly.
</p> <p>Grand Eunuch Wang forced a bitter smile, "Can I ask why?"
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower nodded gently, "So you can die with understanding. The famous healer&#8217;s skill is no exaggeration..."
</p> <p>He finished speaking and turned his attention away from Grand Eunuch Wang, walking over to the window.
</p> <p>Through the window, the night sky revealed the distant sight of Xiaofeng Village, where flames shot into the sky.
</p> <p>The screams from earlier had died down, leaving only the sounds of collapsing burning houses.
</p> <p>Everything was coming to an end.
</p> <p>The firelight and the darkness merged and flowed into the eyes of the Lord of Fengyu Tower.
</p> <p>His gaze was deep, like an endless abyss.
</p> <p>"You take them with you. Fengyu Tower&#8217;s foundation is enough for you to do whatever you wish."
</p> <p>"And you?" Tian Jizi asked, his mouth opening.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower smiled. "I&#8217;ll do what I wish to do. Some things can&#8217;t wait any longer."
</p> <p>He looked toward the northwest, standing tall, and said softly, "My royal brother is about to die. He has too much blood on his hands. Hundreds of beauties in the harem, yet only one son. I want him to feel the same pain I did eighteen years ago."
</p> <p>Tian Jizi fell silent.
</p> <p>After a long pause, he asked again, "Is it worth it?"
</p> <p>Tian Jizi didn&#8217;t understand. The two of them had not met many times over the past fourteen years. Yet, he was entrusted with over a decade of plans.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower smiled.
</p> <p>"If he dies, who will I take my revenge on? And as a father, before he leaves, he must leave something for his son."
</p> <p>When he said this, the Lord of Fengyu Tower&#8217;s voice carried a hint of shame.
</p> <p>"I am a failure as a father. I cannot give you that supreme position in the court. But I can leave something for you."
</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Tian Jizi&#8217;s hand holding the tea cup trembled.
</p> <p>He silently raised the cup and drank it all in one go.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower suddenly smiled.
</p> <p>"That&#8217;s not how you drink tea."
</p> <p>Tian Jizi didn&#8217;t respond. Then, he suddenly asked, "Can I touch you?"
</p> <p>"Of course."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower walked up to Tian Jizi, bending down.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi slowly extended his hand.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower grasped Tian Jizi's hand and placed it on his own face.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi's hand was very pale and youthful, showing no signs of labor or martial training.
</p> <p>It was like that of a scholar.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower held his hand, allowing it to wander over his face.
</p> <p>At the same time, the Lord of Fengyu Tower was studying Tian Jizi's face.
</p> <p>That somewhat youthful face bore a striking resemblance to his own when he was young, about seven or eight parts alike.
</p> <p>Seeing this face, the Lord of Fengyu Tower smiled from the heart.
</p> <p>It was as though he saw another version of himself.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi gently stroked for a while before his left hand moved toward the black cloth covering his eyes.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower held his hand.
</p> <p>"That&#8217;s enough... Don&#8217;t ruin your cultivation."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower stood up, picked up the purple clay teapot, and poured Tian Jizi another cup of tea.
</p> <p>"Drink, but take your time with it. Once you're done, take them and leave."
</p> <p>This time, Tian Jizi did not refuse. He felt his way over to the small tea table, sitting down cross-legged, holding the cup in his hands.
</p> <p>He sipped it slowly, carefully. He didn&#8217;t want to drink too fast.
</p> <p>The two of them sat facing each other in silence.
</p> <p>The Bamboo Loft was very quiet, occasionally broken by the soft sound of tea being sipped.
</p> <p>Nearby, on the bamboo chair, Grand Eunuch Wang slowly closed his eyes, a bitter smile on his face.
</p> <p>He knew that after tonight, things would change.
</p> <p>Everyone had underestimated the Marquis of Su, who had failed to claim the throne.
</p> <p>Because just now, from the Marquis of Su's hands, he had sensed a trace of inner power from a demonic sect.
</p> <p>All teacups in the world are small.
</p> <p>Even when filled to the brim, they will eventually be emptied.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi raised the cup to his lips, feeling the wet tea leaves.
</p> <p>The tea in the cup was gone.
</p> <p>"Let&#8217;s go."
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower sighed lightly.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi nodded silently. Elder Ya stepped forward and supported him.
</p> <p>The remaining twelve from the Earthly Branches followed closely behind him.
</p> <p>From beginning to end, the thirteen of them didn&#8217;t once glance at the Lord of Fengyu Tower.
</p> <p>Their only master now was the young, blind man before them.
</p> <p>With the elder's support, Tian Jizi descended from the Bamboo Loft.
</p> <p>When they reached the door, Tian Jizi extended his hand and lightly touched the black cloth over his eyes.
</p> <p>His fingertips met a slight wetness.
</p> <p>"Ha..."
</p> <p>He took a deep breath and didn&#8217;t linger.
</p> <p>Tian Jizi understood.
</p> <p>The Lord of Fengyu Tower couldn&#8217;t offer him the lofty position of the Emperor.
</p> <p>But...
</p> <p>He had given him a Jianghu of his own.

                            </p><p>On the 18th of July, in an inn in Jiangxia County
</p> <p>The sound of roosters crowing filled the city, and the faint morning light filtered through the window.
</p> <p>Chen Ye sat cross-legged on his bed, slowly opening his eyes, a flash of brilliance passing through them.
</p> <p>He took a deep breath, calming the boundless Primordial Qi in his dantian.
</p> <p>&#8220;Having too much Primordial Qi isn&#8217;t a good thing either,&#8221; Chen Ye sighed lightly.
</p> <p>His body was brimming with energy, and he didn&#8217;t feel the slightest bit of sleepiness.
</p> <p>The entire night had been spent in settling the Primordial Qi within him.
</p> <p>Thankfully, the effects were clear.
</p> <p>When Chen Ye didn&#8217;t circulate his internal energy, it would remain dormant in his dantian.
</p> <p>He didn&#8217;t experience any loss of control over his power.
</p> <p>However, to fully master the vast Primordial Qi within him, more time would be needed.
</p> <p>Chen Ye got out of bed, took the silver mask from the table, and put it on his face.
</p> <p>He walked to the door, pushing open the wooden door.
</p> <p>Hearing the movement, He Wu, who had been sitting by the door guarding with a chair, was suddenly startled awake.
</p> <p>Seeing Chen Ye come out, he hurriedly got up and respectfully greeted, &#8220;Senior!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Mm.&#8221; Chen Ye responded lightly.
</p> <p>&#8220;Senior, I&#8217;ll call them up right away,&#8221; He Wu said with great respect.
</p> <p>The night before, after Chen Ye drew a line on the floor and uttered those words, the people from Wan Jin Hall and </p> <p>Tang Sect had stayed right where they were, too afraid to move, let alone cross the line.
</p> <p>The majestic presence and aura had truly stunned He Wu.
</p> <p>It was probably how it would feel when a Grandmaster emerged.
</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t acknowledge He Wu. He walked straight to the Inn hall and ordered breakfast from the waiter.
</p> <p>Moments later, the doors upstairs opened one by one.
</p> <p>The remaining six second-rank assassins from Fengyu Tower, along with Xiao Lian, came down and stood not far from Chen Ye, all wearing respectful expressions.
</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze swept across them.
</p> <p>Chen Er was pale, lacking color in his face, with a cloth wrapped around his shoulder.
</p> <p>He had been poisoned by Tang Sect&#8217;s deadly poison the previous day, and if it weren&#8217;t for the Tang Sect elder fearing offending Chen Ye and voluntarily offering the antidote, he would likely have already perished.
</p> <p>Zhou Ba, Qian Qi, and He Wu had suffered no injuries and appeared to be in good condition.
</p> <p>Huang San had a cloth wrapped around his left shoulder and a pale complexion.
</p> <p>Qin Yi had a black veil over her face, but it was still evident that she seemed somewhat weak.
</p> <p>The six second-rank assassins all wore respectful expressions, heads lowered, not daring to look at Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze then fell on Xiao Lian.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s expression was complex. In her gaze toward Chen Ye, there was awe, gratitude, unfamiliarity, and an indescribable complexity.
</p> <p>&#8220;Guest, your breakfast&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>The waiter, carrying the breakfast, ran out from the kitchen. Upon seeing the scene before him, the words on his lips were quickly swallowed back down.
</p> <p>He had seen many customers before, and he knew these people must have martial skills.
</p> <p>When serving people from the martial world, one had to be extra careful.
</p> <p>The waiter cautiously placed the breakfast on the table and weakly said to Chen Ye, &#8220;Sir, enjoy your meal.&#8221;
</p> <p>Having said that, he left slowly, as if afraid to disturb Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t pay attention to the waiter&#8217;s actions.
</p> <p>He took two bowls of rice porridge, some plain steamed buns, and a few side dishes from the wooden tray.
</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Lian, come and eat.&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s voice was gentle, much like when he was in the Orphanage.
</p> <p>Upon hearing Chen Ye&#8217;s words, Xiao Lian&#8217;s eyes revealed a complex emotion.
</p> <p>She stood still, not moving.
</p> <p>Qian Qi, standing beside her, quietly nudged her with his elbow.
</p> <p>Only then did Xiao Lian snap out of it, walking over and sitting on the long bench. She took the porridge from Chen Ye&#8217;s hand and started eating slowly.
</p> <p>Chen Ye took off his mask and set it aside.
</p> <p>He calmly ate his breakfast, as though unaware that six people were still standing beside him.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian, holding a steamed bun in her hand, glanced at the familiar face under the mask. Unconsciously, she lowered her head.
</p> <p>For some reason, a feeling of fear arose in her heart.
</p> <p>Qin Yi and the others didn&#8217;t speak, heads lowered, respectfully bowing toward Chen Ye, not daring to look up.
</p> <p>As long as Chen Ye remained silent, they didn&#8217;t dare to move.
</p> <p>Chen Ye ate while pondering.
</p> <p>Initially, he had only wanted to save Xiao Lian, but unintentionally, he had also saved these assassins.
</p> <p>These people used to belong to Fengyu Tower and were all gold-tier assassins.
</p> <p>Their strength was all at the second rank, and in any sect in the martial world, they could serve as elders or guests.
</p> <p>Without the sect master present, second-rank assassins represented the peak power in the martial world.
</p> <p>How to deal with them required careful thought from Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Not long passed.
</p> <p>Chen Ye slowly finished his breakfast, while the six assassins stood motionless for a long time.</p> <p>He put his mask back on and said lightly, &#8220;What are your plans?&#8221;
</p> <p>The six second-rank assassins spoke in unison, &#8220;We have no way to repay the favor of saving our lives. We are willing to serve Senior.&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at them faintly.
</p> <p>Standing before him were the top second-rank assassins in the martial world. Experienced, highly skilled, and professional in their craft. In other words, they were also quite good at making money.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s career path was as an assassin. She would inevitably join an assassin organization. Rather than joining another assassin group and becoming a pawn, it would be better to work for herself.
</p> <p>Not only would it help supplement her family&#8217;s income, but it would also prevent the situation where Xiao Lian might be betrayed and killed by another organization.
</p> <p>Assassins rarely had a good end in their later years.
</p> <p>Chen Ye, as the head of the Orphanage, had to be responsible for every child.
</p> <p>Moreover, once the Orphanage expanded with more people, it would need to be enlarged, right?
</p> <p>After Da Ming got married, he couldn&#8217;t continue living in the Orphanage, could he?
</p> <p>He would have to buy a house for his foolish son, right?
</p> <p>Once the house was bought, a horse would have to be provided too, right?
</p> <p>All of this cost money.
</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed inwardly. At a young age, he felt like he had truly become a father.
</p> <p>After some contemplation, Chen Ye reached into his robes and took out a one-inch-tall jade leaf from the system's store. The pattern on the jade leaf was identical to the pattern on his silver mask.
</p> <p>He placed the jade leaf on the table and said&#65306;&#8220;From now on, you will be members of the Yuye Hall. Taking assassination missions is your expertise. Sources of information, member recruitment, and success or failure of assassinations... I won&#8217;t interfere.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing. After the mission is completed, I take seventy percent of the earnings.&#8221;
</p> <p>In the Inn&#8217;s room...
</p> <p>&#8220;Sit down, why so formal?&#8221; Chen Ye took off his mask and casually sat on the bed.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood at the door, gently biting her lip, her delicate face showing signs of nervousness.
</p> <p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t like how you were in the Orphanage...&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled gently again.
</p> <p>Seeing the familiar smile, Xiao Lian gathered her courage and sat down on the long bench.
</p> <p>&#8220;Director... Are you... Are you a Grandmaster?&#8221;
</p> <p>Xiao Lian looked at Chen Ye's handsome, youthful face and asked the question that had been troubling her all night. </p> <p>Her face was full of reserve, and there was no longer the lively and energetic demeanor she had shown in the Orphanage.
</p> <p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; Chen Ye casually replied.
</p> <p>He had never met a Grandmaster, so he wasn&#8217;t sure how powerful they were.
</p> <p>But one thing he was sure of&#8212;when it came to defense, speed, and internal energy, a Grandmaster would not even be fit to carry his shoes.
</p> <p>The Daoist secret technique, Innate Qi Skill, when mastered, would only result in one innate Qi in the body. But Chen Ye now had boundless innate Qi in his dantian!
</p> <p>As for techniques like [Ground Shrinking Step] or [Indestructible Body], that was another matter entirely.
</p> <p>A Grandmaster?
</p> <p>What a joke!
</p> <p>Hearing Chen Ye&#8217;s confirmation, Xiao Lian&#8217;s sparkling eyes revealed excitement and admiration.
</p> <p>Just as she had thought.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian opened her mouth, full of confusion. She wanted to ask many things but didn&#8217;t dare to speak.
</p> <p>Seeing her look as if she wanted to speak but couldn&#8217;t, Chen Ye couldn&#8217;t help but laugh.
</p> <p>&#8220;I still prefer the rebellious attitude you had when you first arrived at the Orphanage, demanding your wages from me.&#8221;
</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Lian&#8217;s face turned slightly red, feeling a bit embarrassed.
</p> <p>&#8220;If you want to continue honing your skills, then join Yuye Hall. Yuye Hall is made up of our own people, and there won&#8217;t be any situations where the organization betrays you. I can save you once, but I can&#8217;t save you a second time. </p> <p>Do you understand?&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s expression turned serious, and he spoke in a calm tone.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s face showed respect as she nodded, &#8220;I understand.&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye, seeing her respectful attitude, couldn&#8217;t help but smile inwardly.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian, oh Xiao Lian, where&#8217;s that rebellious spirit of yours?
</p> <p>&#8220;One more thing.&#8221; Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze grew sharp as he looked at Xiao Lian.
</p> <p>Xiao Lian, under his direct gaze, felt a slight panic. Her hands, resting on her knees, tightly clenched together, and she nervously said, &#8220;W-what is it?&#8221;
</p> <p>Chen Ye, looking serious, said, &#8220;In the Orphanage, when you&#8217;re not on a mission, you&#8217;ll be responsible for taking care of Xiaofu.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; Xiao Lian looked shocked.
</p> <p>Chen Ye raised an eyebrow, &#8220;What? Is there a problem?&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;N-no,&#8221; Xiao Lian&#8217;s face turned slightly red as she bit her lip, feeling a bit embarrassed.
</p> <p>Oh, so that&#8217;s what he meant.
</p> <p>She had thought&#8230;

                            </p><p>The sky began to break into dawn. A few scattered faint stars adorned the pale blue sky. A snow-white pigeon flew across the sky and landed on a rooftop.
</p> <p>"Coo..."
</p> <p>The pigeon landed on the window sill, its two claws gripping the wooden frame as it made a sound.
</p> <p>Hearing the noise, a pair of fair, jade-like hands gently caught the pigeon, removing a small bamboo tube tied to its leg.
</p> <p>The owner of these hands was a young girl, no more than a teenager.
</p> <p>Dressed as a maid, she was beautiful, with skin as smooth as jade and delicate features.
</p> <p>She carefully unwrapped the bamboo tube, pulling out a folded letter.
</p> <p>The young girl did not read it; instead, she took the letter and descended the stairs.
</p> <p>Downstairs, there was a spacious courtyard, filled with various exotic plants.
</p> <p>In the center of the courtyard stood a scholarly middle-aged man, wearing yellow satin, holding a pair of pruning scissors and carefully trimming the plants.
</p> <p>The young girl approached and respectfully handed him the letter.
</p> <p>The middle-aged man set the scissors down, opened the letter, and began to read.
</p> <p>After a moment, he smiled.
</p> <p>The young girl was startled because, in her memory, her master rarely smiled.
</p> <p>Whenever he did, it usually meant something good or interesting had happened.
</p> <p>The last time he smiled was when the Wan Jin Hall &#8220;received&#8221; a priceless jade statue of Guanyin worth two million taels.
</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Chun, the person you hate most is dead.&#8221;
</p> <p>The scholarly middle-aged man laughed.
</p> <p>The young girl&#8217;s face lit up with surprise. She couldn&#8217;t help but ask, &#8220;Is it Monk Qingyuan? Did he die? How did he die? Was it the Shaolin abbot who took action?&#8221;
</p> <p>Xiao Chun chirped like a sparrow, asking one question after another.
</p> <p>Monk Qingyuan was a late-stage First Grade expert, powerful beyond measure. Even a peak First Grade expert might struggle to defeat him.
</p> <p>The middle-aged man smiled, not answering Xiao Chun&#8217;s questions.
</p> <p>He crumpled the letter into a ball and casually tossed it to the ground.
</p> <p>&#8220;Interesting&#8230; Truly interesting&#8230; To be able to burst Monk Qingyuan apart using internal energy, this person must have already entered the Innate realm. Internal energy cultivation is at its peak!&#8221;
</p> <p>The middle-aged man took a deep breath, his smile gradually fading, replaced by a look of deep apprehension in his eyes.
</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Chun, pass it on. If anyone from Wan Jin Hall encounters a person wearing a silver mask, with a leaf pattern along the edges, they must not be impolite. Whoever can bring that person to the hall, I will make them the Vice Hall Master.&#8221;
</p> <p>The middle-aged man said firmly.
</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Xiao Chun&#8217;s eyes filled with shock.
</p> <p>Vice Hall Master!
</p> <p>The Vice Hall Master here was no mere assistant to one of the twelve halls.
</p> <p>For the master to personally speak&#8212;this could only mean one thing.
</p> <p>That person would be the Vice Hall Master of Wan Jin Hall!
</p> <p>Xiao Chun was stunned by the thought.
</p> <p>Just by bringing the person wearing a silver mask with leaf patterns to the hall, one could become the Vice Hall Master?
</p> <p>Who exactly was that person?
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>Sichuan - Tang Sect
</p> <p>&#8220;Master, Elder Tang Hai has replied.&#8221;
</p> <p>A disciple of the Tang Sect knelt respectfully on the floor.
</p> <p>In front of him sat a lean middle-aged man, wearing black satin embroidered with red patterns. His face was stern and authoritative, radiating the aura of someone who had been in power for a long time.
</p> <p>&#8220;Read it.&#8221;
</p> <p>The middle-aged man spoke indifferently.
</p> <p>&#8220;Understood!&#8221;
</p> <p>Soon, the disciple read the letter sent by the carrier pigeon.
</p> <p>The Tang Sect leader furrowed his brow. After a long moment, he spoke.
</p> <p>&#8220;Cancel the bounty on Qin Yi, Huang San, Zhou Ba, and the others. Do not engage with them if you encounter them in the future. Also, if anyone comes across someone wearing a silver mask with leaf patterns along the edges, they are not to engage. Anyone who violates this will be expelled from the Tang Sect and placed on the kill list!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>The solemn bell tolled through Shaolin Temple.
</p> <p>Monks who had just finished the morning session made their way to the dining hall for breakfast.
</p> <p>A middle-aged monk, with a dignified air, moved swiftly against the flow of monks, as if something urgent was at hand.
</p> <p>Other monks who encountered him paused to bow respectfully, their eyes filled with reverence.
</p> <p>This monk was Master Xuanxi, the head of the Discipline Hall.
</p> <p>Not long after, Xuanxi passed through a corridor and arrived at the door of a quiet room.
</p> <p>The room was filled with the fragrance of sandalwood.
</p> <p>Inside, an elderly monk with snowy white eyebrows, drooping down to his chest, sat on a meditation cushion. His legs were crossed, and he held a string of prayer beads, eyes tightly shut, completely still&#8212;almost as if in a state of deep meditation or entering Nirvana.
</p> <p>From outside the quiet room came a voice.
</p> <p>&#8220;Abbot, Qing Yuan has passed away.&#8221;
</p> <p>The voice echoed into the room.
</p> <p>The elderly monk&#8217;s face showed no sign of joy or sorrow. He paused momentarily before resuming his rotation of the prayer beads.
</p> <p>&#8220;Amitabha&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>The Shaolin Abbot muttered a Buddhist chant, his voice rough, &#8220;Good news.&#8221;
</p> <p>Xuanxi stood outside the quiet room, his expression serious, his posture like a pine tree.
</p> <p>After the Abbot spoke, there was silence.
</p> <p>Hearing the stillness from within, Xuanxi hesitated, unsure whether to leave.
</p> <p>&#8220;Who did this?&#8221; The Shaolin Abbot&#8217;s voice came from the quiet room.
</p> <p>Xuanxi quickly responded, &#8220;A young man named Dong Hua.&#8221;
</p> <p>Upon hearing this, the Shaolin Abbot murmured in reply. &#8220;Good.&#8221;
</p> <p>After that, there was no further sound.
</p> <p>Xuanxi continued, &#8220;Master, the head of the Zhenyuan Escort Agency once trained in the secular courtyard here. He volunteered to escort the Demon-Slaying Vajra back to the temple.&#8221;
</p> <p>After a long pause, the Shaolin Abbot&#8217;s voice finally emerged. &#8220;Good.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>Jiangnan
</p> <p>In a vast martial arts training ground.
</p> <p>A middle-aged man wearing a purple satin robe stood in the center of the arena.
</p> <p>He was tall and sturdy, with a masculine face and a short beard on his chin.
</p> <p>Several young men dressed in gray stood before him, each holding an oval-shaped ball.
</p> <p>&#8220;Throw!&#8221;
</p> <p>One of the men suddenly shouted.
</p> <p>The gray-dressed youths threw the balls into the air, and then swiftly retreated.
</p> <p>The next moment.
</p> <p>&#8220;Boom!&#8221;
</p> <p>A deafening explosion rang out.
</p> <p>The ground shook, soil flew, and black smoke mixed with flashes of fire.
</p> <p>A two-meter-wide crater appeared on the ground, exhaling a sharp, sulfuric smell.
</p> <p>&#8220;We did it!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Boss! We did it!&#8221;
</p> <p>Upon seeing the power of the ball, everyone present cheered.
</p> <p>Lei Jingtian, the leader of the Thunderclap Hall, wore a satisfied smile.
</p> <p>&#8220;Haha! Once this is perfected, my Lei family will be safe for a hundred years!&#8221;
</p> <p>Beside him, an elderly clan elder, supported by a cane, was so excited that tears welled up in his eyes.
</p> <p>The Lei family disciples in the arena danced with joy, celebrating their success.
</p> <p>Lei Jingtian approached the newly created crater, bending down to inspect it carefully.
</p> <p>This was the Lei family&#8217;s newly developed explosive bomb.
</p> <p>Looking at the crater, Lei Jingtian felt his blood rush in excitement.
</p> <p>It&#8217;s done! It&#8217;s really done!
</p> <p>His fists clenched tightly, and his mood soared.
</p> <p>Once that person ascends the throne, the Lei family will rise!
</p> <p>In recent years, the Dawu Dynasty had been facing increasing pressure from border conflicts.
</p> <p>Once this weapon is perfected and distributed to the military, it will surely wipe out those northern barbarians without leaving a single survivor.
</p> <p>At that time, the Lei family's status will rise accordingly!
</p> <p>The Lei family members were ecstatic.
</p> <p>Suddenly, a shadow appeared in the distant sky, letting out a sharp cry.
</p> <p>&#8220;Caw!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Caw!&#8221;
</p> <p>It was a reddish-brown eagle.
</p> <p>Soaring through the air, its sharp eyes scanned the martial arts arena, locking onto a single person.
</p> <p>The eagle slowly folded its wings and landed on Lei Jingtian's shoulder.
</p> <p>Lei Jingtian lovingly stroked its feathers, noticing the letter tied to its claws.
</p> <p>He removed the letter and his gaze fell upon the paper.
</p> <p>After reading the first two lines, a cold smirk appeared on his face.
</p> <p>&#8220;The Tang Sect is nothing but this, their perspective still stuck in the martial world.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;The fall of the Fengyu Tower&#8212;so what&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Short-sighted.&#8221;
</p> <p>He commented disdainfully and continued reading.
</p> <p>As he read further, Lei Jingtian&#8217;s heart skipped a beat, and his face revealed shock.
</p> <p>&#8220;Someone actually used internal energy to forcefully explode Monk Qingyuan?!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;When did such a person emerge in the martial world?&#8221;
</p> <p>His face changed slightly, and then he seemed to remember something.
</p> <p>He sneered.
</p> <p>&#8220;Qing Xuzi really knows how to flatter himself.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Claiming to be on par with a grandmaster&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Does he even deserve that?&#8221;

                            </p><p>Yuhang Orphanage.
</p> <p>The scorching sun hung high in the sky, radiating intense heat.
</p> <p>A drop of sweat trickled down from his forehead to his chin.
</p> <p>&#8220;Plop.&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng, his face flushed red, gritted his teeth and squeezed out a number from his mouth.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ten... ten... fifteen!&#8221;
</p> <p>With all his strength, Sun Sheng pushed himself off the ground.
</p> <p>After he uttered the number, his arms gave way, and he collapsed back onto the ground.
</p> <p>&#8220;Whew... whew...&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng panted heavily, a look of relief on his face.
</p> <p>After catching his breath, Sun Sheng glanced over at Daming, who was calmly doing one-arm handstands without breaking a sweat, and admiration appeared in his eyes.
</p> <p>&#8220;Brother Daming, I really have to hand it to you! You're just too strong!&#8221; Sun Sheng said with envy.
</p> <p>Daming, shirtless, displayed his sun-kissed skin. His shoulder and back muscles subtly bulged, revealing well-defined muscle lines.
</p> <p>Hearing Sun Sheng's words, Daming gave a simple chuckle and said nothing.
</p> <p>He maintained a steady rhythm, alternating his arms every two seconds.
</p> <p>Soon, Daming exhaled, gave a slight shout, and said, &#8220;Fifty!&#8221;
</p> <p>Having completed the fiftieth one-arm push-up, Daming&#8217;s body curved like a shrimp and jumped, his feet landing on the ground.
</p> <p>He stood up, his tan skin gleaming with sweat, as though it had been rinsed with water.
</p> <p>Under the sunlight, his body looked glossy and radiant.
</p> <p>Standing there, Daming&#8217;s chest muscles, biceps, and triceps were all slightly raised.
</p> <p>Even his abdomen showed the faint outline of abs.
</p> <p>No matter how you looked at it, Daming didn&#8217;t seem like a ten-year-old boy.
</p> <p>&#8220;Keep going.&#8221; Daming regulated his breathing, smiling broadly at Sun Sheng.
</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng immediately shook his head. &#8220;Brother Daming, I can&#8217;t go on.&#8221;
</p> <p>He turned over, lying flat on the ground, his chest rising and falling with each breath.
</p> <p>Sun Sheng licked his lips and said, &#8220;Brother Daming, right now all I want is to grab a roast chicken and take a big bite.&#8221;
</p> <p>Just thinking about it, a trail of drool began to slip from the corner of his mouth.
</p> <p>Daming squatted down, just about to continue with another set of exercises, when he heard Sun Sheng's words. He too licked his lips.
</p> <p>&#8220;Gurgle&#8230;&#8221; Daming&#8217;s stomach let out a timely growl.
</p> <p>Hearing the sound, Sun Sheng immediately sprang up from the ground, grinning. &#8220;Brother Daming, you haven&#8217;t eaten enough either, huh?&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Since Foster Father isn&#8217;t around and our cooking skills are pretty poor&#8230; I didn&#8217;t have enough to eat this morning either. How about I go buy a roast chicken for us? We can share?&#8221;
</p> <p>Daming smiled silently, casting a glance at Sun Sheng.
</p> <p>He bent over and pulled a small piece of silver from his short jacket, which was resting on a stool.
</p> <p>It was pocket money left for him by Chen Ye.
</p> <p>Daming often got hungry while chopping firewood on the mountain.
</p> <p>Chen Ye was worried that he might get so hungry on his way home that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to make it, so he specifically left this for him.
</p> <p>Daming smiled foolishly and tossed the silver to Sun Sheng.
</p> <p>Sun Sheng caught the small coin, weighed it in his hand, and his face lit up with joy.
</p> <p>&#8220;Great! We&#8217;ll buy two chickens. We can eat one, and save the other for Foster Father. We&#8217;ll even have money left for a little wine! Heh, I&#8217;ve had a few drinks before back in the gang!&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;That taste, with roast chicken&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Heh&#8230; slurp&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t help but drool, a look of longing on his face.
</p> <p>Daming shook his head and, though still smiling foolishly, his expression grew serious. &#8220;No drinking.&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; The words shattered Sun Sheng&#8217;s beautiful fantasy.
</p> <p>He looked at Daming, confused.
</p> <p>Daming, his face serious, rarely spoke so much.
</p> <p>&#8220;Drinking causes trouble. Dad wanted us to study the comic strips so we could learn the lessons inside. How much of that have you learned?&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng felt a cold sweat bead on his forehead upon hearing this.
</p> <p>When he read the comic strips, he was more focused on the stories than on the deeper lessons, unlike Daming who thought more deeply about it.
</p> <p>Sun Sheng quickly nodded. &#8220;Brother Daming, I was wrong.&#8221;
</p> <p>Daming, seeing Sun Sheng&#8217;s repentant expression, nodded in satisfaction.
</p> <p>He returned to his usual foolish smile.
</p> <p>&#8220;The chicken should be plump.&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s face once again broke into a joyful grin.
</p> <p>Holding the small coin, he hurriedly ran out of the Orphanage.
</p> <p>Watching Sun Sheng&#8217;s cheerful figure, Daming smiled foolishly and continued his workout.
</p> <p>His father had told him to read books, so he had to learn the lessons inside.
</p> <p>His father had told him to train, so he had to do it well. As Chen Daming, he had already learned one important lesson from Water Margin.
</p> <p>Loyalty and righteousness!
</p> <p>Sun Sheng ran out of the Orphanage, jogging down the long street.
</p> <p>A faint scent of perfume wafted through the air.
</p> <p>Sun Sheng slowed down, looking over at the Yihong Courtyard, where the sound of laughter drifted out, and swallowed unconsciously.
</p> <p>The women&#8217;s laughter sounded like bells, like cotton. Just hearing it made Sun Sheng&#8217;s heart soften, his steps becoming light.
</p> <p>No wonder the brothers in the gang used to say that women are like waves.
</p> <p>Now, just listening to their voices, he felt like he could fall headfirst into the sea.
</p> <p>&#8220;Trouble brought by beautiful women!&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t help but mutter.
</p> <p>He couldn&#8217;t even remember where he&#8217;d heard this phrase.
</p> <p>He vaguely remembered it was from an old scholar in his sixties.
</p> <p>That scholar had come out of a brothel, full of emotion, and had sighed as he looked back: &#8220;Trouble brought by beautiful women.&#8221;
</p> <p>At that time, Sun Sheng thought the phrase sounded very profound, so he remembered it.
</p> <p>&#8220;Trouble brought by beautiful women&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>A voice almost identical to Sun Sheng&#8217;s muttered the same phrase at the same time.
</p> <p>Hearing the same four words from two different people, both Sun Sheng and the person beside him froze.
</p> <p>They turned their heads to look.
</p> <p>Standing next to Sun Sheng was a young man in a gray Taoist robe, with a Tai Chi Bagua pattern embroidered on his chest.
</p> <p>He appeared to be in his twenties, with a Bagua compass hanging from his waist and a dog-skin plaster on his face.
</p> <p>In his left hand, he held a flag taller than himself, with the inscription: "Divine Calculation, Guiding the Lost."
</p> <p>Sun Sheng studied the young man while the young man was sizing him up as well.
</p> <p>The young man gave Sun Sheng a once-over, then smiled and said, &#8220;Brother, you&#8217;re quite insightful for someone so young. I suspect your future achievements will be extraordinary!&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng cupped his fists and returned a traditional martial salute, smiling. &#8220;It&#8217;s just a feeling.&#8221;
</p> <p>Hearing this, the young man&#8217;s eyes brightened and he returned the salute respectfully. &#8220;You are truly a remarkable person, Brother!&#8221;
</p> <p>Then, the young man glanced at Sun Sheng&#8217;s face and, with a faint smile, said, &#8220;But, I see darkness in your fate. You&#8217;d best avoid water sources for the time being.&#8221;
</p> <p>Sun Sheng, about to interrupt the young man&#8217;s fortune-telling, watched as the young man gave a faint smile and walked away.
</p> <p>This left Sun Sheng a bit puzzled.
</p> <p>He had met plenty of fortune-tellers before, and normally when they mentioned darkness in the fate, they would follow up with a method to resolve it, boasting about how powerful their charms were.
</p> <p>Then they would try to sell a few peace charms.
</p> <p>That was the typical route.
</p> <p>But this young man just said it and left?
</p> <p>Sun Sheng watched the young man&#8217;s gradually receding figure, shook his head, and didn&#8217;t think too much of it.
</p> <p>Martial world tricksters couldn&#8217;t be trusted.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun took a few steps forward, but then looked back longingly at the Yihong Courtyard.
</p> <p>He reached into his pocket and only found a few small silver coins.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m short on money&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>He took his hand out and shook his head, looking regretful.
</p> <p>He would just have to go another time.
</p> <p>He shook his flag in his left hand as he strolled along the street, his mind empty.
</p> <p>The method of divination in the Divine Machine Sect was different from others.
</p> <p>It emphasized the feeling of the heart.
</p> <p>Once you feel it, you can perform the divination.
</p> <p>The philosophy was about following the right time.
</p> <p>Some things, you can only know when the time is right.
</p> <p>Like now.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun stopped in his tracks, sensing something.
</p> <p>He scanned his surroundings and saw a small courtyard.
</p> <p>The plaque on the courtyard read &#8220;Yuhang Orphanage.&#8221;
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun didn&#8217;t rush.
</p> <p>He first closed his eyes and carefully sensed the surroundings.
</p> <p>When he felt there was no danger, he opened his eyes.
</p> <p>Ever since his master had coughed up blood three and a half months ago, Miao Fengyun had become much more cautious.
</p> <p>He feared predicting a great calamity.
</p> <p>The blood wasn&#8217;t the issue, but he was worried about shortening his life.
</p> <p>He was still young and didn&#8217;t want to die too early.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun entered the Orphanage and saw a young boy practicing strange movements, shirtless.
</p> <p>The boy was doing one-arm handstands, going up and down, sweating like a river.
</p> <p>Even with Miao Fengyun&#8217;s sharp eyes, he couldn&#8217;t tell what martial arts the boy was practicing.
</p> <p>The boy was so focused that he didn&#8217;t notice Miao Fengyun&#8217;s arrival.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ahem...&#8221; Miao Fengyun lightly coughed twice, trying to get the boy&#8217;s attention.
</p> <p>Hearing the cough, Daming lowered his arm and, still upside down, lifted his head to glance at the stranger.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ahem, brother, I see darkness in your fate. Has something troubling happened recently?&#8221;
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun squatted down, speaking gently.
</p> <p>Daming lowered his head again, continuing his training.
</p> <p>He didn&#8217;t stop until he finished a set.
</p> <p>Daming stood up and gave Miao Fengyun a foolish, innocent smile.
</p> <p>&#8220;Ahem, I have a little skill in face reading and divination. Would you like me to give you a fortune?&#8221;
</p> <p>Daming smiled foolishly and remained silent.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun stared at Daming&#8217;s face, his thoughts muddled.
</p> <p>This boy seemed a little simple, didn&#8217;t he?
</p> <p>But since the Divine Machine Sect divined based on fate, there was no harm in offering a free reading.
</p> <p>&#8220;Then, shall I read your fortune, Brother?&#8221;
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun asked tentatively.
</p> <p>Daming smiled foolishly.</p> <p>Miao Fengyun coughed twice. Seeing that Daming didn&#8217;t refuse, he took it as consent.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun set aside his flag and carefully studied Daming&#8217;s face.
</p> <p>&#8220;Hm, the parents&#8217; and siblings&#8217; palaces are dim, both your parents and siblings have passed&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Oh! Your ancestors have blessed you with fortune, you will encounter a benefactor when you turn ten.&#8221;
</p> <p>Listening to Miao Fengyun&#8217;s cryptic muttering, Daming grinned and continued to watch him, his eyes flashing for a moment.
</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll check your marital fate&#8230;&#8221;
</p> <p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun gasped, his face lighting up with joy.
</p> <p>&#8220;Brother, I see the stars in your marital palace, one bright and one dim. You will marry two wives!&#8221;
</p> <p>Daming continued to smile foolishly.
</p> <p>"However, with the dual stars in your marriage palace&#8212;one bright, one dim&#8212;there seems to be a significant gap in your identities, and it looks like they can't coexist. You need to be cautious in handling this, or there may be trouble later." Miao Fengyun's tone became unusually serious. "Otherwise, calamities could occur."
</p> <p>Such a rare dual-star alignment in the marriage palace was not often seen.
</p> <p>After assessing the marriage palace, Miao Fengyun felt that although the boy in front of him seemed a bit silly, his overall face still looked promising.
</p> <p>"Now, let me take a look at your career palace; perhaps you&#8217;re destined for a noble career!" Miao Fengyun chuckled, intending to tease Daming.
</p> <p>But Daming, as always, wore a silly grin and remained unfazed.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun chuckled awkwardly and focused his gaze, but his smile suddenly froze.
</p> <p>"Huh?"
</p> <p>"General star, Prince consort star, King... Duke star??"
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun's expression went blank, and he rubbed his eyes, feeling like he had misread something.
</p> <p>A seemingly simple-minded boy from the nursery hall couldn&#8217;t possibly have the destiny of a general, a prince consort, and a noble, could he?
</p> <p>"I&#8217;ll take another look..."
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun&#8217;s expression became serious, his demeanor now completely focused as he scrutinized Daming&#8217;s face.
</p> <p>"Ah..."
</p> <p>"This..."
</p> <p>"How is this possible!"
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun was completely stunned.
</p> <p>He double-checked, convinced that he hadn&#8217;t made a mistake.
</p> <p>"It&#8217;s impossible! This can&#8217;t be true!"
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun appeared to be trying to convince himself. He moved closer to Daming and looked at his misfortune palace again.
</p> <p>Daming patiently observed the young man in front of him, who was alternating between laughing and being shocked.
</p> <p>He found this person quite amusing.
</p> <p>At least, everything he had said so far seemed accurate.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun studied Daming&#8217;s misfortune palace with intense focus.
</p> <p>Suddenly, he shuddered and his face turned pale, as if he had seen something incredibly alarming.
</p> <p>Miao Fengyun&#8217;s gaze shot up to Daming&#8217;s face, and he extended a trembling finger, exclaiming, "You&#8212;!"
</p> <p>Before he could finish his sentence, he suddenly coughed up a mouthful of fresh blood.
</p> <p>One mouthful wasn&#8217;t enough. He coughed up several more.
</p> <p>The blood splattered across Daming&#8217;s chest and shorts.
</p> <p>Daming&#8217;s smile silently faded as he saw the bloodstains on his new clothes&#8212;clothes his father had just bought for him recently.
</p> <p>Daming clenched his fists, feeling the blood rush to his head, his eyes tinged with red.
</p> <p>Before he could make a move, the young man in front of him swayed and collapsed to the ground, unconscious.
</p> <p>Daming: "???"

                            </p><p>&#8220;Here, young master, your two roasted chickens!&#8221;</p> <p>The innkeeper handed over two wrapped-up roasted chickens to Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Sun Sheng tossed the small silver coins he had been holding into the innkeeper&#8217;s hand.</p> <p>The innkeeper weighed them briefly, and with a beaming smile, handed back a few copper coins.</p> <p>Sun Sheng pocketed the copper coins, grabbed the warm chickens, and quickly ran off.</p> <p>He sped down the long street toward the Orphanage.</p> <p>As he ran, Sun Sheng subconsciously glanced toward the southeast.</p> <p>A thought began to stir in his mind. The hot sun beat down on him from above. The air was thick and oppressive.</p> <p>He thought about dipping into the river for a while.</p> <p>It must be so refreshing to soak in the water right now, right?</p> <p>As soon as this thought came to him, it spread through his mind like a flood breaking through a dam.</p> <p>Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t help but click his tongue at the idea.</p> <p>What am I thinking? Eating chicken is more important.</p> <p>He ran a few more steps.</p> <p>But then, the thought of getting in the water overwhelmed his desire to eat the roasted chicken.</p> <p>&#8220;No, just a quick dip, this heat is unbearable.&#8221;</p> <p>He turned his steps and headed for the outskirts of the city.</p> <p>There was a river just outside of Yuhang County.</p> <p>Soon, Sun Sheng reached the riverbank.</p> <p>The water was clear, and the sound of the flowing stream was soothing. Just listening to the sound of the water made the oppressive heat around him feel much less intense.</p> <p>Sun Sheng set the chickens down on the shore, shed his clothes, and dove into the water with a splash.</p> <p>&#8220;Splash&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>As the cool river water touched his skin, Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t help but let out a satisfied sigh.</p> <p>"Bliss!"</p> <p>In the river, Sun Sheng felt like a drought-stricken land suddenly blessed by a refreshing rain.</p> <p>Moisturizing, soothing&#8230;</p> <p>As he swam a few strokes, Sun Sheng suddenly felt his arms, legs, and body become more agile as he moved through the water.</p> <p>&#8220;Hmm? Why does it feel like my swimming skills have improved?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng was surprised as he floated in the water.</p> <p>Since coming to the Orphanage, he hadn&#8217;t gone near the river. But as soon as he entered, he felt a change.</p> <p>He thought for a moment and then realized, "No wonder the brothers from the gang always said, 'If you swallow a couple of mouthfuls of water, you&#8217;ll learn to swim!&#8217; So it really works!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng thought it was due to soaking in the river a few days ago that his swimming skills had improved.</p> <p>Not thinking too much about it, he dived deeper into the water and swam freely. After a few minutes, the oppressive heat seemed to vanish.</p> <p>Sun Sheng felt that strange thoughts in his mind had disappeared.</p> <p>The desire to eat the chicken once again took the forefront.</p> <p>He took a deep breath, submerged, and quickly swam toward the shore.</p> <p>&#8220;Splash!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng emerged from the water, wiping his face.</p> <p>But then, he froze in surprise.</p> <p>&#8220;Hmm? Strange, why has the river water become warm?&#8221;</p> <p>As soon as he said this, Sun Sheng stiffened, realizing something was wrong.</p> <p>He pushed himself off the water with force, and his body shot backward, several meters.</p> <p>Submerged in the water, Sun Sheng quickly rubbed his face and emerged, his face contorted with anger.</p> <p>On the shore stood a filthy, patched-up old beggar, looking at him with squinted eyes, a strand of snot dangling from his nose and oil stains all over his mouth.</p> <p>With one hand holding up his trousers, the other clutching a chicken leg, the beggar casually tossed the remnants into the river.</p> <p>"Whoosh..."</p> <p>A stream of yellow liquid arced through the air, splashing into the river.</p> <p>Ripples spread across the water, much like a rainstorm.</p> <p>The water quickly turned yellow where it landed.</p> <p>Sun Sheng immediately understood what had caused the warm water.</p> <p>He trembled with anger.</p> <p>&#8220;Old thief! Are you asking for death?!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng roared, furious.</p> <p>The old beggar snorted, glanced sideways at Sun Sheng, and with a grunt, shook his trousers, as if adjusting himself.</p> <p>He chewed on the chicken, spitting out a bone into the river and giving Sun Sheng a provocative look.</p> <p>At that moment, a sense of unease rose in Sun Sheng.</p> <p>He looked over at the oil-paper wrap containing the chicken on the shore.</p> <p>One of the wraps had been torn open, and the golden chicken meat was now exposed, emitting a faint aroma.</p> <p>&#8220;Old thief! You ********!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;***, you ******!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng spat out a torrent of vulgarities, his words sharp and cutting, resounding like the booming of thunder.</p> <p>Having grown up on the streets, and with both his parents gone for two years, Sun Sheng had been left to fend for himself.</p> <p>The curse words of ordinary street folk were burned into his memory long ago.</p> <p>And since Sun Sheng was young, sharp-witted, and quick with his tongue, he was a master when it came to hurling insults.</p> <p>Sun Sheng kept up his verbal assault, the filth coming from his mouth without repetition.</p> <p>The old beggar, standing on the shore and eating his chicken leg, stared in stunned silence, taking quite a while to process.</p> <p>The old beggar&#8217;s face turned beet red, steam practically rising from his forehead.</p> <p>&#8220;You little bastard!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Filthy words! How dare you speak like that!&#8221;</p> <p>He retorted, but it was clear he was running out of material, and his insults were limited to &#8220;little bastard&#8221; and &#8220;little brat&#8221;.</p> <p>Losing in the verbal exchange, the old beggar, in a fit of anger, kicked the two roasted chickens into the river.</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s flood of insults immediately stopped.</p> <p>He stared at the empty shore, his once pale, handsome face now turning ghostly white.</p> <p>&#8220;Damn it!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng gritted his teeth and spat out a venomous curse.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, he dove into the water with a splash, his legs propelling him forward like an arrow.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was close to the shore, and with a powerful push, he shot forward almost instantly.</p> <p>Just as the old beggar was about to bask in his victory and unleash another taunt, he felt a strong grip on his ankle.</p> <p>Looking down, he barely had time to see what was happening before everything spun around.</p> <p>&#8220;Splash!&#8221;</p> <p>The sound of the beggar falling into the water echoed.</p> <p>Sun Sheng had grabbed the old beggar's ankle and pulled him into the river.</p> <p>A powerful slap struck the beggar&#8217;s face.</p> <p>Sun Sheng floated in the water, his body agile, his black hair spread out like a fan in the river.</p> <p>He puffed his cheeks, his eyes wide, his pale face under the water looking almost ghostly white.</p> <p>Like a drowned corpse.</p> <p>The beggar, pulled into the water, received a solid slap to the face.</p> <p>He was dazed, completely stunned. The next moment, the old beggar panicked.</p> <p>He quickly extended his arms and legs, revealing surprisingly good swimming skills.</p> <p>The old beggar's head broke through the water&#8217;s surface as he shouted, "Kid, do you know who I am?!"</p> <p>&#8220;Gurgle&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Before he could finish his sentence, Sun Sheng dragged him back underwater, and bubbles spilled from his mouth.</p> <p>&#8220;Bam!&#8221;</p> <p>Two heavy punches landed on the old beggar&#8217;s eye sockets.</p> <p>His vision went black, and golden stars appeared before his eyes. He gritted his teeth, about to unleash his ultimate move, when suddenly, he remembered the rule he had set...</p> <p>The old beggar suppressed his internal energy and trembled with rage.</p> <p>"Damn it, when a tiger falls in the plains, it gets bullied by dogs!"</p> <p>Sun Sheng landed two solid punches on the beggar&#8217;s face, showing no mercy.</p> <p>After delivering the blows, Sun Sheng yanked the old beggar&#8217;s collar and pulled him back to the surface to let him breathe.</p> <p>"Kid, I&#8217;m the Monster Hero from the South Sea! You... you... you dare hit me?"</p> <p>The old beggar barely managed to get those words out before Sun Sheng dragged him back underwater.</p> <p>Two more punches.</p> <p>Sun Sheng puffed his cheeks, his face as pale as death, his eyes burning with fury.</p> <p>The beggar&#8217;s earlier actions had thoroughly enraged him.</p> <p>Having been a street urchin for two years, Sun Sheng had developed the habit of being frugal. He couldn&#8217;t stand wasting food.</p> <p>But more importantly, those chickens were bought with the money that Da Ming had given him!</p> <p>And that silver was given to Da Ming by his adoptive father!</p> <p>The money spent on those two chickens had come from Chen Ye&#8217;s hard-earned cash!</p> <p>The old beggar&#8217;s actions made Sun Sheng feel like he had betrayed Chen Ye and Da Ming&#8217;s trust.</p> <p>He&#8217;d bought two chickens, only to have them kicked into the river!</p> <p>The thought alone made Sun Sheng feel like he was suffocating.</p> <p>He absolutely had to teach this old beggar a lesson!</p> <p>After a few more punches, Sun Sheng hauled the beggar up to the surface again.</p> <p>"Kid, you&#8217;re not done, are you?! I&#8217;ll teach you a lesson and show you that the Monster Hero of the South Sea isn&#8217;t some useless..."</p> <p>"Glub glub..."</p> <p>The old beggar still looked full of swagger, but before he could finish his words, Sun Sheng dragged him under again.</p> <p>Under the water.</p> <p>The old beggar started to fight back, but Sun Sheng was like a fish in the water, dodging every blow. The beggar&#8217;s strikes missed him entirely.</p> <p>Instead, Sun Sheng landed a few punches on the old beggar&#8217;s body.</p> <p>The beggar grimaced in pain.</p> <p>By the time Sun Sheng brought the beggar back up to the surface, his rage had mostly subsided.</p> <p>The old beggar was still defiant, cursing, &#8220;Little bastard, let me tell you, the leader of the Haijing Gang is my disciple! If you keep hitting me&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>When Sun Sheng heard the first half of that sentence, his anger flared up once more.</p> <p>Without a second thought, he yanked the old beggar down into the water again.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was so angry his teeth were grinding.</p> <p>How could someone as legendary as the leader of the Haijing Gang be this filthy old man&#8217;s disciple?</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>&#8220;You old thief! Next time you see me, get the hell away!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng put on a fierce gangster-like expression, trying to intimidate the old beggar.</p> <p>As he spoke, his gaze swept over and caught sight of a wine gourd hanging from the beggar&#8217;s waist.</p> <p>Without hesitation, he grabbed it and gave it a shake.</p> <p>A sloshing sound came from inside&#8212;about half a gourd&#8217;s worth of liquid remained.</p> <p>A thought flashed through Sun Sheng&#8217;s mind as he pulled out the stopper.</p> <p>Immediately, a strong, spicy aroma of liquor wafted out.</p> <p>Catching the scent, Sun Sheng instinctively swallowed.</p> <p>Back when he used to &#8220;mix&#8221; with the gang, he had tasted cheap liquor before.</p> <p>But the watery swill that sold for a few copper coins a bowl was nothing compared to what was in this gourd.</p> <p>Just the smell of this liquor alone was enough to make one feel light-headed.</p> <p>&#8220;Wow! Where&#8217;d you steal such fine wine from?&#8221; Sun Sheng couldn&#8217;t help exclaiming.</p> <p>Even though he had never drunk good wine, he could tell this was no ordinary stuff.</p> <p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t drink that!&#8221; The old beggar grew anxious, staring at Sun Sheng with wide eyes.</p> <p>Sun Sheng cast him a sidelong glance and sneered. &#8220;You ate my chicken. Why can&#8217;t I drink your wine?&#8221;</p> <p>With that, he lifted the gourd high and tilted his head back.</p> <p>A clear, jade-green liquid flowed out.</p> <p>A rich fragrance filled the air.</p> <p>The wine trickled into Sun Sheng&#8217;s mouth, some spilling onto the collar of his robe.</p> <p>There wasn&#8217;t much in the gourd&#8212;within a few breaths, he had drained it dry.</p> <p>Seeing that nothing more came out, he casually tossed the gourd aside and wiped his mouth with his sleeve.</p> <p>&#8220;Refreshing!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Hahahahaha!&#8221;</p> <p>He burst into hearty laughter, his face tinged with a faint flush.</p> <p>Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the trees, casting dappled shadows on his damp face.</p> <p>Fair-skinned and strikingly handsome.</p> <p>Without sparing the old beggar another glance, Sun Sheng strode away.</p> <p>The beggar stared dazedly at the gourd now drifting in the river, a bitter smile creeping onto his lips.</p> <p>Lifting his head, he watched Sun Sheng&#8217;s retreating figure, his expression gradually turning peculiar.</p> <p>Suddenly, he called out in a booming voice, &#8220;Kid!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a beggar!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;In ten days, I&#8217;ll show you what I mean!&#8221;</p> <p>Beneath the shade of the trees, Sun Sheng paused and turned back with a smirk, spitting on the ground.</p> <p>&#8220;Damn fool.&#8221;</p> <p>Then, his figure faded into the distance.</p> <p>By the riverbank, the old beggar sat in silence, watching Sun Sheng disappear, the corner of his mouth curling into a smile.</p> <p>&#8220;That little bastard&#8230; reminds me of my younger self.&#8221;</p> <p>With that, Nan Yiyun couldn&#8217;t help but laugh aloud.</p> <p>But after just a few chuckles, his face suddenly turned deathly pale, sweat beading on his forehead.</p> <p>His body collapsed onto the riverbank, his lips rapidly losing color.</p> <p>Frost formed on his eyebrows and beard.</p> <p>He curled up, shivering violently, his teeth chattering uncontrollably.</p> <p>Despite the blazing sun overhead, he seemed trapped in the dead of winter.</p> <p>Soon, his patched clothing stiffened, encased in ice.</p> <p>A chilling aura spread from his body, freezing a thin layer of ice over the water at the river&#8217;s edge.</p> <p>No one knew how much time passed before Nan Yiyun&#8217;s body slowly relaxed.</p> <p>The frost on him melted under the sun, turning into cold water.</p> <p>&#8220;Hu&#8230; hu&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>He gasped for breath, his complexion shifting from ashen to red.</p> <p>Using his sleeve, he wiped the moisture from his forehead, then sat up and cast a deep look at the wine gourd floating in the river.</p> <p>&#8220;Could this&#8230; be fate?&#8221;</p> <p>He sat motionless by the river, staring blankly at the water.</p> <p>His scruffy, unkempt face carried a trace of bitter amusement.</p> <p>After a long while, he leaned toward the river, pushing back his hair to get a good look at his reflection.</p> <p>A weathered, timeworn face stared back at him.</p> <p>Yet, beneath the years, the remnants of a once-handsome youth were still visible.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun studied his reflection for a moment before bursting into laughter.</p> <p>&#8220;That brat&#8230; almost as handsome as I was!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And he dares call me a beggar?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;In ten days, I&#8217;ll open his eyes!&#8221;</p> <p>With a stroke of his beard, a sharp glint flickered in his eyes. Pursing his lips, he took a deep breath.</p> <p>Suddenly, a gust of wind rose.</p> <p>Waves rippled across the hundred-meter-wide river, sending schools of fish darting away.</p> <p>On the riverbank, trees swayed wildly, and birds scattered in alarm.</p> <p>Then, a figure appeared above the water.</p> <p>With a few flickering movements, it swiftly disappeared into the distance.</p> <p>Only the restless ripples on the water remained.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>The Orphanage</p> <p>Chen Ye, dressed in pristine white robes, appeared outside the courtyard in a flash, moving as if shrinking the ground beneath his feet.</p> <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p> <p>As soon as he stepped through the gate, he saw a young man dressed like a fortune teller collapsed in front of Daming.</p> <p>Blood trickled from the young man&#8217;s lips, his eyes rolled back, and his body convulsed violently.</p> <p>&#8220;Daming, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye frowned slightly as he stepped into the courtyard.</p> <p>Hearing the gentle voice, Daming&#8217;s face instantly lit up with a smile.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad!&#8221;</p> <p>He turned his head and called out loudly.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked up to Daming, patted his head, then glanced at the fortune teller on the ground. His gaze shifted to the bloodstains on Daming&#8217;s chest.</p> <p>In an instant, his expression darkened.</p> <p>&#8220;Bandits?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;A fortune teller.&#8221; Daming responded honestly, his face simple and sincere.</p> <p>A fortune teller?</p> <p>Chen Ye blinked.</p> <p>That much blood&#8212;did he actually predict something?</p> <p>Chen Ye rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the convulsing Miao Fengyun slowly regained consciousness. His blurred vision barely registered the figure standing before him.</p> <p>Before he could even make out Chen Ye&#8217;s features, an ominous feeling surged within him.</p> <p>This man&#8230; can calculate fate! Hurry, calculate!</p> <p>His mind hadn&#8217;t caught up yet, but his body reacted instinctively. A shiver ran down his spine, and a deep chill spread through his limbs.</p> <p>A terrifying thought took hold&#8212;If I calculate this, I might die.</p> <p>Suddenly, Miao Fengyun flipped over and bolted upright. He didn&#8217;t even bother wiping the blood off his lips.</p> <p>Using all four limbs, he scrambled desperately toward the courtyard entrance.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll die&#8230; I&#8217;ll really die!!!</p> <p>An overwhelming sense of life-threatening danger engulfed him.</p> <p>Without a second thought, he dropped onto all fours and shot off like a dog, fleeing at a speed that would put real dogs to shame.</p> <p>Chen Ye: &#8220;???&#8221;</p> <p>Daming: &#8220;???&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s teeth ached just watching. Clicking his tongue, he muttered, &#8220;Stop letting just anyone in here.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Mm!&#8221; Daming nodded firmly, smiling with honest enthusiasm.</p> <p>Chen Ye swept his gaze around. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Xiao Sheng?&#8221;</p> <p>Just as he spoke, a cold mechanical voice rang in his ears.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, Host!

                            </p><p>Outside the Orphanage, on the Long Street</p> <p>A lone figure swayed unsteadily, staggering toward the orphanage.</p> <p>Hic!</p> <p>Sun Sheng's face was flushed red, his eyes hazy with intoxication, and his entire body reeked of strong alcohol.</p> <p>He stumbled along, swaying left and right, until he finally reached the orphanage&#8217;s entrance. Raising his head, he stared at the signboard above the gate.</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s weird&#8230; Why does our signboard have ten characters now?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng stopped in his tracks, his face flushed as he stretched out a finger, counting the characters one by one.</p> <p>&#8220;Let me count&#8230; I could&#8217;ve sworn it was&#8230; five&#8230; hic!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Five characters&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>He stared at the signboard in confusion, unable to comprehend how it had mysteriously doubled in length in the short time he had been away.</p> <p>Inside the Courtyard</p> <p>Chen Ye reclined on a lounge chair, eyes closed as he regulated the innate energy within his body.</p> <p>Hearing the commotion at the entrance, he opened his eyes.</p> <p>At the gate, Sun Sheng stood drunkenly, pointing at the signboard, counting with a serious expression.</p> <p>Chen Ye got up and walked over. The overpowering stench of alcohol made him frown.</p> <p>&#8220;Xiao Sheng? Where did you drink so much?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng lowered his head, his bleary eyes locking onto Chen Ye.</p> <p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; He blinked in confusion. &#8220;Why are there three Foster Fathers?&#8221;</p> <p>After a brief pause, he abruptly dropped to his knees and kowtowed.</p> <p>&#8220;O mighty Foster Fathers above! Your unworthy son, Sun Sheng, kowtows to you!&#8221;</p> <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p> <p>The sound of his forehead hitting the ground echoed loudly.</p> <p>Chen Ye quickly pulled him up, frowning. &#8220;Xiao Sheng, what&#8217;s going on? Why are you this drunk?&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing those words, Sun Sheng sniffled, and tears and snot streamed down his face.</p> <p>He threw himself into Chen Ye&#8217;s arms, wailing uncontrollably.</p> <p>&#8220;Foster Father!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve wronged you!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I was wrong!&#8221;</p> <p>His cries were so miserable that anyone listening would be moved to tears.</p> <p>Chen Ye patted his shoulder gently, his voice soothing.</p> <p>&#8220;What happened? Tell me.&#8221;</p> <p>With teary eyes, Sun Sheng clung to Chen Ye&#8217;s chest and sobbed, &#8220;Foster Father!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I lied to you.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, it&#8217;s okay. Lied about what?&#8221; Chen Ye patted him reassuringly, coaxing him patiently.</p> <p>&#8220;Foster Father&#8230; I never actually joined the Haijing Gang. Everything I said before&#8230; I was just bragging.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I only had an older brother I followed around, running errands in exchange for food&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Foster Father, I was wrong!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have lied to you!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;All of it was just talk.&#8221;</p> <p>As he clung to Chen Ye, his tears and snot smeared all over Chen Ye&#8217;s clothes.</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't help but laugh.</p> <p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s what this is about? It&#8217;s fine, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p> <p>Back at the orphanage, Sun Sheng often talked about his two years of wandering the streets.</p> <p>He boasted about joining the Haijing Gang, having subordinates under him, and all sorts of grand exploits.</p> <p>Chen Ye had always known he was exaggerating but never exposed him.</p> <p>&#8220;But, Xiao Sheng, why did you drink so much?&#8221;</p> <p>Between sniffles, Sun Sheng recounted his earlier encounter by the riverbank.</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, just two roasted chickens.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye patted Sun Sheng&#8217;s shoulder, comforting him. &#8220;We&#8217;re not short on chickens.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame you.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng was overwhelmed with emotion, tears pouring even harder.</p> <p>He took a deep breath and suddenly declared, &#8220;Foster Father, I&#8217;ve made up my mind!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll become a water bandit! My alias will be White Streak in the Waves - Zhang Shun!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll build my own Water Margin stronghold and make you the boss! The courtesans of Yihong Brothel, the top performers of Cui Lu Pavilion&#8212;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll snatch them all for you! We&#8217;ll fight side by side like father and son, like true brothers who take down tigers together!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;A real man conquers the raging waves!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye nearly choked on air, his vision darkening for a moment.</p> <p>Now he understood why Sun Sheng had completed the mission so suddenly.</p> <p>Turns out&#8230; he wanted to be a damn water bandit!</p> <p>&#8220;Huh? Foster Father, why are you shaking?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Haha! Foster Father, don&#8217;t be so excited!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t even finished yet.&#8221; Sun Sheng, face still streaked with tears, beamed with excitement.</p> <p>&#8220;Once we gather enough men, we&#8217;ll recruit an elite instructor, like the leader of the imperial guards! With our army, I&#8217;ll conquer the world for you.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make you the Emperor!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;And the Empress&#8212;well, we&#8217;ll take her too! As the saying goes, if you&#8217;re going to sleep with someone, it might as well be the Empress&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s vision went completely black.</p> <p>Not only a water bandit&#8212;this brat wanted to be a damn rebel too!!!</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Later That Evening</p> <p>Da Ming returned from outside, carrying a wooden basin. As soon as he stepped into the courtyard, the heavy stench of alcohol hit him.</p> <p>Hurriedly, he hung up the freshly washed shorts on a drying pole and rushed inside.</p> <p>Inside, Chen Ye sat by the bedside while Sun Sheng lay sprawled on the bed, his chest exposed, his face flushed, streaked with dried tears, deep in sleep.</p> <p>&#8220;Dad,&#8221; Da Ming called respectfully.</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced at him and briefly explained Sun Sheng&#8217;s drunken confession.</p> <p>&#8220;When he wakes up, don&#8217;t bring it up again.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;He&#8217;s already cried his heart out.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t be able to eat dinner tonight, so don&#8217;t wake him.&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming nodded, grinning as he looked at Sun Sheng with newfound warmth.</p> <p>After settling Sun Sheng in, Chen Ye quietly checked on the next room. Xiaofu was fast asleep, her breathing steady.</p> <p>Chen Ye let out a relieved sigh and returned to his lounge chair, pulling up the system interface.</p> <p>His points balance remained at 5075&#8212;he had just spent 2 points on a bottle of sobering medicine for Sun Sheng.</p> <p>&#8220;No way half a gourd of wine got him this drunk&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye muttered, growing suspicious about the old beggar&#8217;s identity.</p> <p>Then again, if he were some martial arts master, how did Sun Sheng beat him black and blue?</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll check tonight&#8217;s records and find out.&#8221;</p> <p>Deciding not to dwell on it, he turned his attention back to the system.</p> <p>&#8220;System, redeem one orphan skill draw.&#8221;</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Remaining Points: 75]</p> <p>[Available Orphan Skill Draws: 2]</p> <p>&#8220;System, start the draw!&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye mentally commanded.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Drawing orphan skills&#8230;]</p> <p>A blue, translucent spinning wheel appeared before him.</p> <p>It spun twice before stopping.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Congratulations, Host! You have obtained the orphan trait: &#8220;Qi Absorption.&#8221;]</p> <p>[Congratulations, Host! You have obtained the orphan trait: &#8220;Righteous Aura.&#8221;]</p> <p>[Qi Absorption: Each breath subtly strengthens lung function and capacity.]</p> <p>[Righteous Aura: Protected by righteous energy, all evils retreat. Luck improves, and the sense of justice is heightened.]</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the new traits, deep in thought.</p> <p>&#8220;[Qi Absorption] seems quite ordinary, but it pairs well with [Water Ghost].&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s perfect for Xiao Sheng.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;But this [Righteous Aura]&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye frowned slightly.</p> <p>Xiao Lian had already stepped onto the path of an assassin, and now Xiao Sheng was set on becoming a Water Bandit.</p> <p>These two kids had already gone astray.</p> <p>And Da Ming&#8230;</p> <p>Chen Ye glanced toward the courtyard, where Da Ming was chopping firewood.</p> <p>Sensing Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze, Da Ming paused, wiped his sweat, and grinned. &#8220;Dad.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded in satisfaction, his tone earnest.</p> <p>&#8220;Da Ming, among all the children, you&#8217;re the one I worry about the least.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Remember, we are just ordinary people. We live our lives properly and do things honestly.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;A life like that may seem plain, but it has its own kind of richness.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Do you understand?&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming nodded firmly, his grin wide. &#8220;Dad, I got it.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Good. Keep chopping wood.&#8221; Chen Ye nodded.</p> <p>&#8220;Alright!&#8221;</p> <p>Da Ming responded enthusiastically, raising his axe and continuing to split the logs.</p> <p>Chen Ye had made his decision.</p> <p>He would give the [Righteous Aura] trait to Xiaofu.</p> <p>This trait brought good fortune, but it also strengthened one&#8217;s sense of justice.</p> <p>Initially, Chen Ye considered giving it to Da Ming, but he knew&#8212; too much righteousness isn&#8217;t always a good thing. Sometimes, it only brings trouble.</p> <p>He just wanted Da Ming to live a peaceful and happy life. That was enough.</p> <p>&#8220;Xiaofu, that little troublemaker&#8212;she&#8217;s already mischievous at such a young age. If I don&#8217;t intervene now, who knows what kind of person she&#8217;ll become?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;If she strays even further, it&#8217;ll be a disaster.&#8221;</p> <p>Chen Ye sighed.</p> <p>Then, he assigned the [Qi Absorption] skill to Sun Sheng and the [Righteous Aura] skill to Xiaofu.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

You have obtained the special building: Martial Training Ground.]</p> <p>[Martial Training Ground: Training and practicing martial arts here will yield enhanced growth.]</p> <p>Seeing the drawn building, Chen Ye frowned slightly.</p> <p>A martial training ground wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate inside the orphanage courtyard.</p> <p>"Looks like it&#8217;s time to expand."</p> <p>He had already made up his mind.</p> <p>Once Xiaofu grew a little older and could run around the whole courtyard, the space would start to feel cramped.</p> <p>For children, a courtyard wasn&#8217;t just a courtyard.</p> <p>It was their entire world.</p> <p>Xiaofu didn&#8217;t have the best start in life, but Chen Ye wanted her to have a happy childhood.</p> <p>Every child deserves love.

Maybe, if he pushed himself further, he&#8217;d ascend to immortality on the spot!</p> <p>Damn, while others practice martial arts, am I actually cultivating immortality?</p> <p>Just imagining it gives me chills!</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s mind was filled with grand fantasies.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Commencing daily settlement!]</p> <p>A translucent blue screen appeared before Chen Ye.</p> <p>The daily event reports of the orphans were laid out before his eyes.</p> <p>Da Ming, Xiao Lian, and Xiaofu were all fine&#8212;nothing out of the ordinary.</p> <p>The only problem was&#8230; Sun Sheng.</p> <p>[Sun Sheng dragged a Grandmaster-level expert&#8212;the South Sea Phantom&#8212;into the water, earning 500 points.]</p> <p>[Sun Sheng viciously beat up the Grandmaster-level expert&#8212;the South Sea Phantom&#8212;earning 500 points.]</p> <p>[The Grandmaster-level expert&#8212;the South Sea Phantom&#8212;was beaten so badly by Sun Sheng that he called him &#8216;Grandfather,&#8217; earning 500 points.]</p> <p>[Sun Sheng robbed the Grandmaster-level expert&#8212;the South Sea Phantom&#8212;earning 500 points.]</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the event log, falling into deep thought.</p> <p>Wait&#8230;</p> <p>System bro, hold up.</p> <p>I need a second to process this.</p> <p>Are you absolutely sure there&#8217;s no error in this daily settlement?</p> <p>Chen Ye was utterly shocked by what he was reading.</p> <p>Xiao Sheng&#8230; just how tough is your life?!</p> <p>You made a Grandmaster call you &#8216;Grandfather&#8217;&#8230;?</p> <p>And then you robbed him?!</p> <p>Chen Ye stared at the system screen in silence for a long time.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Total points gained: 2,120]</p> <p>[Current remaining points: 2,195]</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Sun Sheng&#8217;s gratitude level has increased!]</p> <p>[Current gratitude level: 73%]</p> <p>In an instant, the points Chen Ye had previously spent were replenished, climbing back to over two thousand.</p> <p>"Not bad&#8212;just 7% more gratitude, and I&#8217;ll be able to draw another Orphanage Director Skill."</p> <p>A satisfied expression appeared on Chen Ye&#8217;s face.</p> <p>[Ding!]</p> <p>[Activating Sun Sheng&#8217;s exclusive mission!]</p> <p>[Sun Sheng&#8217;s Exclusive Mission: Water Bandit]</p> <p>[Mission Details: Carry out 100 raids.]</p> <p>[Mission Rewards: 5,000 points, 200 taels of silver, Sun Sheng&#8217;s exclusive wish item 1]</p> <p>Seeing the sudden mission notification, Chen Ye sighed.</p> <p>Another one straying off the path.</p> <p>Please, Da Ming and Xiaofu, don&#8217;t go astray too&#8230;</p> <p>Living an honest life as an ordinary person&#8212;is that really so bad?</p> <p>Chen Ye closed the system interface, slowly shutting his eyes, focusing his mind inward.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Pingjiang Prefecture, Haijing Gang Branch</p> <p>Night had deepened, and torches burned brightly along the docks.</p> <p>The flickering flames illuminated the surroundings, turning night into day.</p> <p>Dozens of brawny men, clad in coarse hemp clothing, carried heavy cargo on their shoulders.</p> <p>The damp wooden planks creaked beneath their weight.</p> <p>A man who had just placed his load in the warehouse stretched his shoulders and shouted, "Two more ships to unload, brothers! Put your backs into it!"</p> <p>"The sooner we&#8217;re done, the sooner we can crawl into our wives&#8217; beds!"</p> <p>The man had a rugged face, and the back of his coarse garment was embroidered with a whale emblem.</p> <p>At his words, the surrounding workers burst into laughter.</p> <p>"Hahaha&#8230;"</p> <p>"We&#8217;re dead tired, and you still have the energy to &#8216;handle&#8217; your wife?"</p> <p>"How about I take your place instead? Some of us aren&#8217;t as lucky, you know!"</p> <p>"Get lost! Go practice your &#8216;solo techniques&#8217; somewhere else!"</p> <p>The men joked and bantered, and the dock&#8217;s atmosphere lightened considerably.</p> <p>Among them, a leaner man chuckled as he placed his cargo in the warehouse, wiping sweat from his forehead.</p> <p>A cool night breeze drifted in from the sea, carrying a faint salty scent.</p> <p>It brushed against his skin&#8212;refreshing and soothing.</p> <p>&#8220;Whoosh&#8230; whoosh&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Gentle waves lapped against the shore, sending white foam spraying into the air.</p> <p>The man turned toward the vast ocean, taking a deep breath of the salty night air.</p> <p>Suddenly, he froze, his face shifting to one of utter shock.</p> <p>He immediately shouted, "Brother Bao!"</p> <p>The burly man who had just been rallying the workers looked up, a sack of goods on his shoulder. "What&#8217;s wrong?"</p> <p>The lean man pointed toward the sea, his voice trembling. "Brother Bao, there's someone on the water!"</p> <p>Bao Laosan narrowed his eyes and set down the sack.</p> <p>"Which idiot dares to mess with the Haijing Gang?"</p> <p>"No&#8230; no! It&#8217;s not pirates! It&#8217;s just one person!"</p> <p>The lean man&#8217;s voice was filled with panic.</p> <p>Bao Laosan&#8217;s heart tightened. He quickly turned to look.</p> <p>Under the night sky&#8212;</p> <p>The dark ocean churned like ink.</p> <p>Through the shifting waves, Bao Laosan barely made out a shadow&#8212;a figure sprinting across the water&#8217;s surface at incredible speed.</p> <p>That figure was fast&#8212;within just a few breaths, they had closed the distance.</p> <p>Now, everyone could see them clearly.</p> <p>It was&#8230; an old beggar.</p> <p>His patched-up robes were tattered and filthy, his appearance completely unkempt.</p> <p>Yet&#8212;</p> <p>He ran on water as if walking on solid ground.</p> <p>With each step, his feet barely rippled the surface.</p> <p>And in the next moment&#8212;</p> <p>He leaped onto the dock.</p> <p>Seeing that this man could actually walk on waves, the members of the Haijing Gang were all stunned.</p> <p>&#8220;Get me the person in charge!&#8221;</p> <p>The old beggar leaped onto the dock, standing arrogantly as he shouted.</p> <p>Upon seeing the old beggar, Bao Laosan&#8217;s heart pounded violently. He hurried forward and respectfully said, &#8220;Master Nan, I&#8217;m the one in charge here.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun glanced at him sideways, then suddenly cleared his throat and spat a thick glob of phlegm&#8212;right onto Bao Laosan&#8217;s face.</p> <p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re worthy of calling me &#8216;Master Nan&#8217;?&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan remained utterly respectful, allowing the mucus to slide slowly down his face.</p> <p>He immediately corrected himself: &#8220;Grandpa!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun nodded in satisfaction. Then, without hesitation, he cleared his throat again and spat another glob of phlegm on the other side of Bao Laosan&#8217;s face.</p> <p>&#8220;A little reward for you.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Thank you, Grandpa, for your generous reward.&#8221; Bao Laosan&#8217;s face now bore two streaks of phlegm, yet he remained as deferential as ever.</p> <p>The old beggar didn&#8217;t spit again but instead asked, &#8220;Let me ask you something!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Have there been any recent rumors in the martial world about treasures or valuable items?&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan replied respectfully, &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that the chief escort of Zhenyuan Escort Agency is currently transporting a sacred Vajra Pestle from Shaolin Temple, intending to return it to the monastery.&#8221;</p> <p>Upon hearing this, Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eyes gleamed.</p> <p>&#8220;Heh! Those bald donkeys from Shaolin actually let the Vajra Pestle slip out into the world?&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan added, &#8220;The Vajra Pestle was stolen by the Renegade Monk Qingyuan from Shaolin Temple. Now that he&#8217;s dead, the chief escort of the Zhenyuan Escort Agency&#8212;who has ties to Shaolin&#8212;has taken it upon himself to return the relic.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Pah!&#8221;</p> <p>The old beggar spat another thick glob of phlegm&#8212;this time, right onto Bao Laosan&#8217;s forehead.</p> <p>&#8220;You think I didn&#8217;t already know that? Why the hell are you running your mouth?&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan&#8217;s eyelids twitched slightly. His face was now adorned with three streaks of phlegm.</p> <p>Around them, the Haijing Gang members clenched their fists, their eyes wide with rage. Their veins bulged in fury.</p> <p>Bao Laosan was the branch leader of the Pingjiang Prefecture division, a formidable expert at the late third-rank level. He was a leader who led by example, never shying away from hard work, and was deeply respected by the gang members.</p> <p>Seeing him being humiliated like this made them seethe with anger.</p> <p>If Bao Laosan hadn&#8217;t stayed silent, they might have already rushed forward with their weapons.</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right to discipline me, Grandpa.&#8221; Bao Laosan called out respectfully.</p> <p>He remained in a submissive stance, hands clasped in a respectful salute, not daring to move an inch.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun glanced at him, satisfied with his obedient demeanor.</p> <p>&#8220;Get me a roast chicken and some good wine.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun swaggered toward the warehouse on the dock.</p> <p>&#8220;Brothers! Get my grandpa a roast chicken and some fine wine!&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan quickly assigned someone to handle the task.</p> <p>&#8220;Everyone, keep working. I&#8217;ll be back soon.&#8221;</p> <p>He called out to the other gang members before quickly hurrying after Nan Yiyun, ready to serve him.</p> <p>The other gang members still didn&#8217;t quite understand what was happening.</p> <p>But one thing was clear&#8212;Bao Laosan treated that old beggar with extreme respect.</p> <p>Yuyu: This is the current situation of the Challenge goals</p> <p>1) 10 votes on NU for a bonus chapter. </p> <p>Initial votes: 26</p> <p>Current count: 5</p> <p>2) 400 people on reading list ( NU reading list) for 2 chapters</p> <p>Current count: 284</p> <p>3) 2 reviews on NU for a Bonus chapter till 10 reviews.</p> <p>Initial reviews: 1</p> <p>Current count: 0</p> <p>Here's the link /series/raising-orphans-not-assassins/</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>"Hiccup..."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun tossed aside the chicken bone in his hand, his mouth glistening with grease, and let out a full-bellied burp.</p> <p>Rubbing his swollen stomach, he stood up and drained the rest of the wine in his jar in one gulp.</p> <p>"Crash!"</p> <p>He casually flung the empty jar to the ground, shattering it into eight pieces.</p> <p>Bao Laosan stood respectfully by his side.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun shot him a sidelong glance and commented, &#8220;You&#8217;re in your thirties and only at late third-rank?&#8221;</p> <p>"Isn&#8217;t that embarrassing? When I was your age, I was already first-rank!&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan responded humbly, &#8220;Grandpa is right to reprimand me.&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing his continued obedience and efficiency, Nan Yiyun nodded in satisfaction.</p> <p>"You know my rules."</p> <p>"Three spits of phlegm&#8212;three palm techniques in return."</p> <p>"Watch carefully. If you fail to learn them, that&#8217;s on you!&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan&#8217;s heart pounded, his face lighting up with joy.</p> <p>"Thank you, Grandpa!"</p> <p>Nan Yiyun leapt into the air, raising his left palm high before striking downward&#8212;</p> <p>As if he were attacking an invisible enemy.</p> <p>Bao Laosan widened his eyes, sweat beading on his forehead as he focused intently, afraid to miss even the smallest detail.</p> <p>Judging from the trajectory, the palm strike was aimed at the Baihui acupoint on an opponent&#8217;s head.</p> <p>But just as Bao Laosan assumed this, Nan Yiyun suddenly flicked out his right hand&#8212;without exerting any force&#8212;yet with astonishing speed.</p> <p>Bao Laosan froze.</p> <p>What the hell was that move...?</p> <p>It looked an awful lot like a backhanded slap!</p> <p>Before he could process it, Nan Yiyun landed on the ground and immediately launched a vicious kick&#8212;sharp and ruthless.</p> <p>Judging by the angle, it was a brutal low blow.</p> <p>After demonstrating the three techniques, Nan Yiyun saw the confusion on Bao Laosan&#8217;s face and spat on the ground.</p> <p>"Pah!"</p> <p>"Useless. Completely unteachable."</p> <p>"Remember, only use these in life-or-death situations."</p> <p>With that, Nan Yiyun grabbed an unopened wine jar and swaggered out of the dock warehouse, leaving Bao Laosan standing in a daze.</p> <p>"That last move..."</p> <p>He subconsciously kicked his foot and murmured, "That wasn&#8217;t a palm technique either..."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun, clutching his wine jar, leapt onto the sea and strode away on the waves.</p> <p>A gang member close to Bao Laosan rushed over and whispered, &#8220;Big Brother, who was that just now?&#8221;</p> <p>Still immersed in thought over the three techniques, Bao Laosan snapped back to reality. He glanced around before lowering his voice:</p> <p>"That was our boss&#8217;s master."</p> <p>The gang member&#8217;s eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>"The legendary Grandmaster, the Southern Sea Phantom?"</p> <p>"That&#8217;s right. It was him."</p> <p>Excited, the gang member asked, &#8220;Boss, did you just fight him?&#8221;</p> <p>According to the rumors, the Southern Sea Phantom always suppressed his cultivation when fighting an opponent&#8212;if you were third-rank, he&#8217;d lower himself to third-rank as well.</p> <p>If you managed to defeat him at the same level, he&#8217;d teach you a few techniques.</p> <p>However, he was notoriously eccentric. If you amused him, he might reward you with martial arts secrets regardless.</p> <p>It was said that their own gang leader, Qiong Longshan, had greatly pleased the Southern Sea Phantom, who then taught him his signature skill&#8212;Roaring Waves Palm.</p> <p>After years of relentless practice, Qiong Longshan used that first-rank palm technique to establish the Haijing Gang as the most powerful coastal force.</p> <p>Bao Laosan shook his head. &#8220;My foundation is weak, and my skills are too common. How could I stand against Senior Nan?&#8221;</p> <p>The gang member sighed in disappointment. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pity.&#8221;</p> <p>Bao Laosan didn&#8217;t respond. His eyes flickered with thought.</p> <p>In his mind, he replayed the three &#8220;palm techniques&#8221; Nan Yiyun had just shown him.</p> <p>A Few Days Later&#8212; The Dawu Dynasty&#8217;s Capital&#8212;Bianliang.</p> <p>Late at night.</p> <p>The city blazed with lights, the night markets bustling with life.</p> <p>People wove through the streets, their faces glowing with joy.</p> <p>Bianliang had no curfews&#8212;it was the most famous Sleepless City in all of Dawu.</p> <p>On the streets&#8212;</p> <p>A middle-aged man strolled through the lively night scene.</p> <p>He wore a black silk robe embroidered with gold, his eyes sweeping across the city&#8217;s streets, shops, and landmarks, filled with a sense of nostalgia.</p> <p>It had been eighteen years since he had last set foot in Bianliang.</p> <p>Now that he had returned, Zhao Kai felt the weight of time&#8212;so much had changed.</p> <p>The site where the Prince Su Manor once stood&#8212;had become Hongbin Tower, the grandest restaurant in Bianliang.</p> <p>A single meal there cost at least a thousand taels of silver, a gathering place for the empire&#8217;s elite.</p> <p>Zhao Kai gazed at Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>Eighteen years ago, he had lost the imperial succession struggle.</p> <p>That night&#8212;</p> <p>Prince Su Manor had been engulfed in flames, reduced to ashes.</p> <p>Had it not been for his loyal Xuanjia Guards, who sacrificed themselves to smuggle him out of the city, he would have perished in Bianliang that night.</p> <p>Perished alongside his wives, concubines, and children&#8212;burned alive in the inferno.</p> <p>After that night, the world no longer had Prince Su.</p> <p>Instead&#8212;</p> <p>A new figure emerged.</p> <p>The Master of Fengyu Tower.</p> <p>A ghost lurking in the shadows.</p> <p>"Eighteen years..."</p> <p>The once-mighty Prince Su, now Zhao Kai, Master of Fengyu Tower, sighed.</p> <p>Now that he had returned, it was time to settle old debts.</p> <p>At a steady pace, Zhao Kai walked toward Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>Tonight&#8212;</p> <p>The Crown Prince was hosting a grand banquet there.</p> <p>Before he even reached Hongbin Tower, two streets away, he was stopped by the Imperial Guards.</p> <p>A magnificent Yushi Stallion, pure white and powerfully built, stood in the street.</p> <p>Seated atop the horse was a young general clad in golden armor.</p> <p>He held a silver python spear, his cold eyes scanning the passersby.</p> <p>No one dared approach. People veered away from a distance, avoiding trouble.</p> <p>Only one man walked forward&#8212;his expression calm.</p> <p>The young general&#8217;s gaze locked onto Zhao Kai&#8217;s black-and-gold embroidered robes.</p> <p>Zhao Kai spoke, his voice cultured and gentle. &#8220;Tell me&#8212;does the Wu family still control the Imperial Guards?&#8221;</p> <p>The young general hesitated.</p> <p>The man before him had a commanding presence, as if he were born to rule.</p> <p>Subconsciously, he answered, &#8220;Yes, the Wu family still holds the position.&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Kai nodded faintly. &#8220;Wu Feng had good foresight, choosing to side with Zhao Xie early.&#8221;</p> <p>"Insolence!"</p> <p>"How dare you address His Majesty by name!"</p> <p>Enraged, the young general thrust his silver spear forward&#8212;</p> <p>A strike carrying the force of a third-rank martial artist.</p> <p>Zhao Kai remained indifferent. His deep eyes barely flickered as he gently waved his sleeve.</p> <p>"Whoosh&#8212;"</p> <p>A bone-chilling gust of wind surged forth.</p> <p>The spear instantly froze, ice creeping from its tip up to the general&#8217;s hand.</p> <p>"Ah&#8212;!"</p> <p>The young general gasped&#8212;his body stiffened.</p> <p>His skin turned a deathly pale gray.</p> <p>Life vanished from his eyes in an instant.</p> <p>Even his Yushi Stallion froze solid, frost coating its pristine fur.</p> <p>With a loud thud, both the general and his horse collapsed.</p> <p>Along with them&#8212;</p> <p>The surrounding Imperial Guards fell lifelessly, their bodies frostbitten, hair and beards dusted with ice.</p> <p>All the guards stationed on that street had been slain by a single flick of Zhao Kai&#8217;s sleeve.</p> <p>Zhao Kai coughed lightly and continued his leisurely walk toward Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>It wasn&#8217;t long before the strange stillness of the street caught the attention of passersby.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Fireworks burst into the night sky above Bianliang.</p> <p>The nearby Jinwu Guards, seeing the signal, immediately mobilized toward Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>Zhao Kai walked slowly, taking in the familiar yet distant streets as memories surged through his mind.</p> <p>This was the front street of Prince Su&#8217;s residence. As a youth, he played kickball here.</p> <p>Next door was Bluestone Alley, where he had once ambushed and beaten the son of the Minister of Rites with a sack over his head.</p> <p>Why had he done that?</p> <p>Zhao Kai couldn&#8217;t quite recall. He vaguely remembered it had something to do with a courtesan.</p> <p>Memories of his younger years in Bianliang resurfaced one by one, but they were wrapped in a hazy veil.</p> <p>He could only recall fragments, never the full picture.</p> <p>The past was separated from him by time itself.</p> <p>His steps were unhurried, yet his pace was swift.</p> <p>In just a few strides, he arrived in front of Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>Zhao Kai tilted his head up, gazing at the grand, four-story restaurant adorned with lanterns. Suddenly, he spoke.</p> <p>&#8220;Come out.&#8221;</p> <p>From the shadows behind him, an elderly eunuch in a purple robe hunched forward, stepping into the light.</p> <p>His face was aged and pallid, his long, snow-white eyebrows drooping to the corners of his eyes.</p> <p>It was impossible to determine his exact age, but his entire being exuded the air of someone in decline, his vitality ebbing away.</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s complexion was deathly pale. He raised a hand to his mouth, coughing incessantly.</p> <p>Only after a long moment did his face regain some color.</p> <p>His voice was hoarse as he spoke.</p> <p>&#8220;Even from a distance, I could smell the blood-soaked stench of the Profound Ice Demonic Art.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Prince Su, since when did you align yourself with the demonic sects?&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Kai remained silent.</p> <p>He simply looked at the eunuch and smiled.</p> <p>Then, from within him, several muffled pops rang out.</p> <p>His internal energy reversed through his meridians, coursing along an eerie, unorthodox path throughout his body.</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s expression shifted.</p> <p>&#8220;The Heavenly Demon Dissolution Technique?&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Kai&#8217;s gaze remained calm as he flicked his sleeve.</p> <p>A misty white vapor surged out.</p> <p>In an instant, the street was shrouded in thick fog.</p> <p>A biting cold radiated from within the mist.</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s sharp eyes fixed on the fog as his voice trembled with fear.</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve reached the Grandmaster realm?&#8221;</p> <p>As he spoke, he accidentally inhaled a wisp of the chilling air, and a violent coughing fit overtook him.</p> <p>Forcing his energy into action, his figure blurred as he retreated more than twenty yards in an instant.</p> <p>His face was ghastly pale, his body convulsing as he coughed uncontrollably.</p> <p>His internal energy churned wildly, rampaging through his meridians like an unbridled storm.</p> <p>Several breaths later, he finally managed to suppress the chaos within his body.</p> <p>His complexion returned to normal, and his coughing ceased.</p> <p>But Zhao Kai was no longer in sight.</p> <p>The next moment, piercing screams and panicked shouts erupted from within Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>The eunuch trembled violently, his body shivering. Deep within his eyes, a fear far beyond mortal terror took hold.</p> <p>It was as if the mist had awakened the nightmares he most wished to forget.</p> <p>He knew exactly what was happening inside Hongbin Tower.</p> <p>But there was nothing he could do.</p> <p>A dull thud sounded.</p> <p>From the fourth floor of Hongbin Tower, a severed head was thrown down.</p> <p>It belonged to a young man.</p> <p>He wore a white jade coronet, his eyes wide open in death.</p> <p>His face was pallid, his skin shriveled, and his severed neck bore a clean cut&#8212;its fresh blood already frozen solid.</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s face drained of all color as he stared at the decapitated head.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Bianliang Imperial Palace</p> <p>Inside a lavish bedchamber, dozens of candles flickered, illuminating the room as bright as daylight.</p> <p>In the corner, a small incense burner released curling wisps of calming fragrance, drifting into the air and dissolving into silence.</p> <p>The room was deathly still.</p> <p>On the bed sat a middle-aged man, dressed in a bright yellow robe embroidered with dragon motifs.</p> <p>His features were imposing, yet exhaustion weighed heavily on his face. Dark circles encased his eyes, evidence of sleepless nights.</p> <p>Before him, on the floor, lay the severed head of a young man.</p> <p>Beside the head, a eunuch in a deep purple robe knelt.</p> <p>His face was ghastly pale, his forehead pressed against the ground, beads of cold sweat dripping down his skin.</p> <p>The middle-aged man&#8217;s voice was slow, yet carried an unmistakable authority.</p> <p>&#8220;Banban, I remember you once told me&#8230;&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Among all the grandmasters in this world, you rank in the top three.&#8221;</p> <p>The kneeling eunuch trembled as he responded in a hushed voice.</p> <p>&#8220;Your Majesty, Prince Su&#8230; he cultivated the Profound Ice Demonic Art of the demonic sects.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I was wounded twenty years ago in battle with the Black Tortoise Banner Master of the demonic sect&#8230; that injury never fully healed&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;He and I were both in the Grandmaster Realm, but he used a technique of mutual destruction.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8230; was no match for him.&#8221;</p> <p>The middle-aged man closed his eyes.</p> <p>His expression remained unchanged, just as it had when he first saw his son&#8217;s severed head.</p> <p>He asked, &#8220;Where is Prince Su&#8217;s body?&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch immediately replied, &#8220;Outside.&#8221;</p> <p>The Emperor of Da Wu said nothing.</p> <p>For a long time, silence filled the room.</p> <p>Then, he spoke again.</p> <p>&#8220;I had only one son.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;My brothers&#8230; I killed nearly all of them eighteen years ago.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The few who survived&#8230; have no sons.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Banban, tell me&#8212;what will become of the Dawu dynasty now?&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s body trembled violently.</p> <p>Cold sweat drenched his back. He pressed his lips tightly together, not daring to utter a single word.</p> <p>His fear reached its peak.</p> <p>He understood all too well.</p> <p>With the prince&#8217;s death, the imperial bloodline of Dawu was severed.</p> <p>All that remained were the princesses.</p> <p>The Dawu Emperor, Zhao Xie, let out a sigh.</p> <p>&#8220;Banban, if only you had died alongside the prince. Wouldn&#8217;t that have been better?&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch&#8217;s body shook uncontrollably.</p> <p>&#8220;I deserve to die a thousand times over&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Xie shook his head. His tone was gentle, devoid of blame.</p> <p>&#8220;I do not fault you. You are old&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;When one grows old, they fear death.&#8221;</p> <p>He gazed at his son&#8217;s severed head, his deep eyes devoid of emotion.</p> <p>After a long silence, Zhao Xie spoke softly.</p> <p>&#8220;The throne of Dawu can only be passed to my descendants.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Banban, I need you to do something.&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch shuddered and bowed low.</p> <p>&#8220;This servant will lay down his life for Your Majesty!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Take all the princesses to the Autumn Hunting Grounds. Give each of them a knife.&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Xie&#8217;s voice was almost tender.</p> <p>&#8220;By dawn, I want a result.&#8221;</p> <p>At that moment, the eunuch felt an indescribable chill rise from the depths of his soul&#8212;</p> <p>A coldness even more terrifying than the Profound Ice Demonic Art.</p> <p>Eunuch Feng Man clenched his teeth, his body trembling in pure terror.</p> <p>Zhao Xie glanced at the eunuch who had served him faithfully for years and waved a hand.</p> <p>&#8220;Go.&#8221;</p> <p>Then, exhaustion crept onto his face.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8230; am tired.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p> <p>The eunuch slowly rose, his body stooped, his legs weak.</p> <p>He bowed and stepped backward, carefully shutting the chamber doors.</p> <p>Feng Man looked at the intricately carved red lacquered doors he had just sealed with his own hands.</p> <p>He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.</p> <p>A bitter smile tugged at his aged face.</p> <p>Only those who serve beside the emperor understand&#8212;serving a king is like walking alongside a tiger.</p> <p>Turning away, his hunched figure moved forward, his left hand rising to his mouth as he coughed softly.</p> <p>After a few coughs, his gaze landed on the body lying in the center of the courtyard.</p> <p>It was Prince Su&#8217;s corpse.</p> <p>Zhao Kai&#8217;s lifeless body remained in a meditative posture. His skin was gray, his vitality long extinguished. Crystals of frost clung to his brows and hair.</p> <p>His body had frozen solid&#8212;yet his eyes were open, and he was smiling.</p> <p>After assassinating the crown prince, he had succumbed to the backlash of the Heavenly Demon Dissolution Technique.</p> <p>Atop the roof of Hongbin Tower, he had perished in silent meditation.</p> <p>&#8220;Madman.&#8221;</p> <p>As Feng Man passed by Zhao Kai&#8217;s corpse, he muttered under his breath.</p> <p>Grandmasters were rare in this world.</p> <p>To become one was to gain the right to establish one&#8217;s own sect and rise among the elite, ensuring a legacy for a hundred years.</p> <p>Yet Zhao Kai&#8230; had chosen death.</p> <p>A true madman&#8212;one who had destroyed his own dynasty.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>As the sound of the doors shutting reached his ears, Zhao Xie reclined on his dragon bed, inhaling deeply as he closed his eyes.</p> <p>His expression remained calm, undisturbed.</p> <p>As if nothing had happened.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>The rooster crowed.</p> <p>Dawn&#8217;s first light painted the sky a pale blue.</p> <p>A golden sun peeked over the horizon, casting its radiance.</p> <p>Bianliang, draped in morning gold, glowed beneath its touch.</p> <p>&#8220;Your Majesty, this servant has returned.&#8221;</p> <p>Eunuch Feng Man stood outside, his voice hushed.</p> <p>&#8220;Enter.&#8221;</p> <p>A weary voice drifted from within.</p> <p>Feng Man stepped inside.</p> <p>As he did, he glanced over his shoulder at the figure behind him, his expression complex and unreadable.</p> <p>He approached the emperor&#8217;s bedside and supported Zhao Xie as he attempted to sit up.</p> <p>The emperor&#8217;s breaths were labored, his illness visibly worsening.</p> <p>In just a few hours, his condition had deteriorated further.</p> <p>&#8220;Let me see&#8230;&#8221; Zhao Xie&#8217;s voice was hoarse.</p> <p>He straightened his back and turned his gaze to the third person in the room.</p> <p>Before he could see clearly, a thick, metallic scent of blood filled his nostrils.</p> <p>The heavy stench caused Zhao Xie&#8217;s pale face to flush with a tinge of red, his expression tinged with excitement.</p> <p>His dragon-like eyes fixed on the figure before him.</p> <p>Then, a flicker of confusion crossed his gaze.</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8230; who was your mother?&#8221;</p> <p>A cold, youthful voice responded.</p> <p>&#8220;Concubine Wang.&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Xie narrowed his eyes, as if trying to recall the woman&#8217;s face.</p> <p>Yet no matter how long he pondered, he could not picture her.</p> <p>Shaking his head, he asked, his voice tinged with excitement&#8212;</p> <p>&#8220;How many did you kill?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Fifteen.&#8221; The voice was calm, detached.</p> <p>Zhao Xie nodded, a hint of concern slipping into his tone.</p> <p>&#8220;And how did it feel&#8212;killing for the first time?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No different from slaughtering chickens.&#8221; The voice paused, then continued.</p> <p>&#8220;I only killed one. After that, my legs went weak.&#8221;</p> <p>For a moment, Zhao Xie was stunned.</p> <p>Then, he burst into laughter.</p> <p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Well done!&#8221;</p> <p>His laughter was unrestrained, genuine joy lighting up his face.</p> <p>Zhao Xie&#8217;s pale complexion flushed with excitement.</p> <p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Zhao Yuzhu.&#8221;</p> <p>Zhao Xie&#8217;s gaze locked onto the girl before him, his eyes shining with a strange light.</p> <p>&#8220;From now on, you will not be called that.&#8221;</p> <p>His voice was solemn, each word deliberate.</p> <p>&#8220;You are Zhao Zhu.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You are my lost second prince.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;From this moment on&#8212;you are the Crown Prince of Dawu.&#8221;</p> <p>His voice rang out like thunder, shaking the very air.</p> <p>The weight of his words was enough to drive the world into madness.</p> <p>But the girl before him showed no reaction.</p> <p>She remained expressionless.</p> <p>Silent.</p> <p>Zhao Xie stared at her, and she stared back at him.</p> <p>For a long time, Zhao Xie laughed.</p> <p>"I am very pleased. Do you have any wishes?"</p> <p>The girl in the room replied coolly, "I want Eunuch Song dead."</p> <p>Zhao Xie frowned slightly. "Who is Eunuch Song?"</p> <p>"The eunuch who delivered my mother&#8217;s monthly stipend."</p> <p>Zhao Xie was momentarily stunned by this answer.</p> <p>Then, after a brief pause, he laughed.</p> <p>"Very well!"</p> <p>"I will grant your wish."</p> <p>"Banban, bring Eunuch Song here and have him executed by lingchi."</p> <p>"I want to watch him die with Zhu'er!"</p> <p>The elderly eunuch, Feng Man, respectfully replied, "As you command."</p> <p>Zhao Xie turned to look at Zhao Zhu once again and asked, "Are you satisfied?"</p> <p>Zhao Zhu remained silent, simply staring at Zhao Xie.</p> <p>Her gaze was like that of a young wolf&#8212;cold and fierce.</p> <p>Zhao Xie saw the look in her eyes and sighed.</p> <p>"Good. You are much stronger than the Crown Prince."</p> <p>"At least&#8230; he never dared to look at me this way."</p> <p>After saying this, Zhao Xie waved his hand. "Banban, take her to change her clothes."</p> <p>"Have breakfast prepared."</p> <p>Feng Man bowed respectfully. "As you command."</p> <p>With a slight bend in his waist, he led Zhao Zhu out of the sleeping quarters.</p> <p>A short while later.</p> <p>Feng Man returned to the entrance of the palace.</p> <p>This time, he was alone.</p> <p>"Your Majesty&#8230;"</p> <p>Standing outside the door, he called softly.</p> <p>"Come in," Zhao Xie, still lying on his bed, asked, "What is it now?"</p> <p>Feng Man entered, knelt on the floor, and hoarsely said, "Your Majesty, the Second Prince has a younger sister."</p> <p>Hearing these words, Zhao Xie fell silent.</p> <p>After a long while, Zhao Xie let out a quiet sigh.</p> <p>"Still not ruthless enough."</p> <p>TL Notes:&#160;</p> <p>Small Incense Burner:</p> <p>Lingchi: usually translated "slow slicing" or "death by a thousand cuts", was a form of torture and execution used in China from around the 10th century until the early 20th century. It was also used in Vietnam and Korea. In this form of execution, a knife was used to methodically remove portions of the body over an extended period of time, eventually resulting in death. Lingchi was reserved for crimes viewed as especially heinous, such as treason. Even after the practice was outlawed, the concept itself has still appeared across many types of media.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Morning.</p> <p>A light mist drifted through the valley.</p> <p>The faintly damp air settled on the skin, bringing a slight chill.</p> <p>At the valley&#8217;s entrance, a young figure in white appeared. Lips red, teeth white, features delicate and refined.</p> <p>Dressed in men&#8217;s clothing, a small yellow bundle slung over her arm.</p> <p>Hua Xiyue glanced back at Hundred Flowers Valley and flashed a mischievous smile.</p> <p>&#8220;Hundred Flowers Valley, goodbye!&#8221;</p> <p>Her voice was soft yet lively.</p> <p>With that, a bright smile bloomed on her delicate face, radiant and captivating.</p> <p>Though she wore men&#8217;s clothing&#8212;Unless someone was blind, it was obvious she was a woman.</p> <p>And not just any woman&#8212;an exceptionally beautiful one.</p> <p>Hua Xiyue walked along the mountain path, her steps light and brisk. Her face brimmed with anticipation for the world beyond.</p> <p>Once she left the valley, the vast seas and boundless skies awaited her!</p> <p>She took a deep breath, inhaling the air outside the valley, eyes half-closed in delight.</p> <p>As if the air outside was fresher, more fragrant than within.</p> <p>Sixteen years!</p> <p>She had spent sixteen whole years inside the valley!</p> <p>Did anyone even understand what she had been through all this time?</p> <p>The martial world, handsome young masters, famed swords, and fine steeds&#8230;</p> <p>Hua Xiyue was coming!</p> <p>Her steps quickened, her heart filled with excitement and longing.</p> <p>With a light movement, she vanished ten yards ahead in a blink.</p> <p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p> <p>Suddenly, an aged voice rang out on the mountain path.</p> <p>The moment Hua Xiyue heard it, her smile froze.</p> <p>Her eyes widened in shock as she turned toward the voice.</p> <p>Standing on the path ahead was an elderly man, clad in gray robes, tall and slender, his posture as straight as bamboo.</p> <p>His hair and beard were completely white, his presence ethereal.</p> <p>Upon seeing Hua Xiyue, his expression darkened instantly.</p> <p>&#8220;Ah! Grandfather!&#8221;</p> <p>The stiffness on Hua Xiyue&#8217;s face melted into a bright grin.</p> <p>Her large, expressive eyes curved into crescents, revealing a pair of adorable little canine teeth.</p> <p>She ran toward him, threw her arms around his, and shook it playfully.</p> <p>&#8220;Grandfather, you&#8217;re finally back! Xiaoyue has been waiting here for days.&#8221;</p> <p>The old man&#8217;s face turned even darker. He raised a finger, pointing at her men&#8217;s outfit and the bundle slung over her arm.</p> <p>&#8220;Xiaoyue, do you think your grandfather is so old he&#8217;s gone senile?&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing her plan exposed, Hua Xiyue pouted and quickly changed the subject.</p> <p>&#8220;Grandfather&#8230; didn&#8217;t you go to find Donghua? Why are you back so soon?&#8221;</p> <p>The old man snorted in displeasure.</p> <p>&#8220;I intended to bring Donghua back to Hundred Flowers Valley to be your husband. His lightness skill is unparalleled, and even Qing Xuzi acknowledges his talent. Among the younger generation, he is undoubtedly among the top. Marrying into the Hua family wouldn&#8217;t disgrace him.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Hua Xiyue&#8217;s face twisted in dissatisfaction.</p> <p>She stomped her foot, grumbling, &#8220;Grandfather, I haven&#8217;t even met this person&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to marry him. If I have to marry, I&#8217;ll choose someone who catches my eye. I won&#8217;t settle for some random guy&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>The old man&#8217;s face darkened, his sleeve flicking.</p> <p>&#8220;Nonsense. Marriage is decided by one&#8217;s parents and matchmakers. How can such a serious matter be treated like child&#8217;s play?&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing his anger, Hua Xiyue obediently shut her mouth.</p> <p>The old man sighed and softened his tone.</p> <p>&#8220;Besides, it no longer matters.&#8221;</p> <p>Hua Xiyue&#8217;s eyes lit up. She asked eagerly, &#8220;Why? Did he die? How did he die? Was it gruesome?&#8221;</p> <p>At her words, the old man&#8217;s face turned even darker.</p> <p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; he scolded. &#8220;A grandmaster is not someone you can speak of so recklessly.&#8221;</p> <p>Hua Xiyue blinked in surprise, her delicate face filled with disbelief.</p> <p>&#8220;Donghua&#8230; is a grandmaster?&#8221;</p> <p>The old man nodded. &#8220;His strength is likely no less than mine.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Great! That means I don&#8217;t have to marry him!&#8221;</p> <p>Hua Xiyue beamed with joy.</p> <p>The old man chuckled.</p> <p>&#8220;You think you could marry a grandmaster? With that mischievous attitude, you wouldn&#8217;t even qualify to be his servant. You&#8217;ll suffer once you get married.&#8221;</p> <p>Hua Xiyue rolled her eyes and huffed.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not getting married. Even if he were an immortal, I wouldn&#8217;t marry him.&#8221;</p> <p>The old man&#8217;s face darkened, about to scold her again.</p> <p>Hua Xiyue clung to his arm and pleaded playfully.</p> <p>&#8220;I just want to stay with Grandfather. If I get married, I won&#8217;t see you anymore.&#8221;</p> <p>A trace of amusement flickered in the old man&#8217;s eyes. He tapped her forehead lightly.</p> <p>&#8220;You, you&#8230; You only know how to sweet-talk your grandfather.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Hehe&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Enough laughing. Go back and copy the family rules ten times. If I hadn&#8217;t returned early, you would&#8217;ve already escaped the valley!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Ah? No, Grandfather&#8230; I was wrong.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No room for negotiation.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Grandfather&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Hmph.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Grandfather&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;Fine, two times. Not a word less.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Yay! Grandfather is the best!&#8221;</p> <p>A few days later.</p> <p>Outside Yuhang County, in the river winding around the city.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was soaking in the water, utterly relaxed.</p> <p>For some reason, if he didn&#8217;t submerge himself in the river every few days, he would feel unbearably itchy, like ants crawling all over him.</p> <p>He figured it was an aftereffect of floating on driftwood for hours last time.</p> <p>Thankfully, it didn&#8217;t interfere with daily life, so he let it be.</p> <p>What was a quick soak every now and then? Besides, he noticed he could hold his breath longer underwater&#8212;several seconds more than before.</p> <p>Swimming lazily, he felt the itch fade away. Flipping over, his gaze swept toward the riverbank.</p> <p>There, next to his clothes, stood a figure.</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;You again, old thief!&#8221;</p> <p>Recognizing the ragged old beggar from a few days ago, Sun Sheng&#8217;s expression darkened.</p> <p>&#8220;Damn it! Old man, put down my clothes!&#8221;</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, Sun Sheng dove underwater, cutting through like a sharp fish.</p> <p>Splash!</p> <p>He broke through the surface and leaped onto the shore, eyes blazing with anger&#8212;</p> <p>Only to see the old beggar sitting next to his clothes, holding a wine gourd.</p> <p>&#8220;Want some?&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun offered the gourd to him.</p> <p>Sun Sheng ignored it, eyeing his clothes warily. He thought the old man had come to steal them as revenge.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun scoffed at his suspicion. &#8220;What do you take me for?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng sneered, grabbing his clothes.</p> <p>&#8220;So you&#8217;d rather steal chickens?&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s face flushed red.</p> <p>&#8220;You know nothing!&#8221;</p> <p>Taking a swig from his gourd, he smirked.</p> <p>&#8220;Kid, didn&#8217;t you call me a penniless bum last time? Today, I&#8217;ll show you something priceless.&#8221;</p> <p>A smug grin spread across his face.</p> <p>Sun Sheng dressed quickly, his damp hair clinging to his fair, handsome face.</p> <p>With lightning speed, he snatched the wine gourd from Nan Yiyun and took a swig.</p> <p>He frowned.</p> <p>&#8220;This wine&#8217;s not as good as last time.&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing Sun Sheng&#8217;s boldness, Nan Yiyun chuckled, a flicker of appreciation in his gaze.</p> <p>Noticing the old man&#8217;s smile, Sun Sheng immediately spat out the wine.</p> <p>&#8220;You poisoned it, didn&#8217;t you?!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s face twisted in pain.</p> <p>&#8220;You brat! That&#8217;s Shaoxing yellow wine worth ten taels of silver per jug!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng hesitated, sniffed the wine, then scoffed.</p> <p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t taste good.&#8221;</p> <p>Tying the gourd to his waist, he turned to leave.</p> <p>&#8220;I better not see you again!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grabbed him.</p> <p>&#8220;Wait! You haven&#8217;t seen the treasure yet!&#8221;</p> <p>Suspicious, Sun Sheng followed him into a grove.</p> <p>Crunching over fallen leaves, he saw it.</p> <p>At the center stood a three-meter-tall golden staff, its top as wide as a clay pot.</p> <p>Gold rings dangled from it, chiming softly in the breeze.</p> <p>The sound was crisp and pleasant, like the sacred melodies of a Buddhist temple, bringing a sense of tranquility to those who heard it.</p> <p>Sun Sheng stared at the massive golden Vajra Staff, his face filled with shock.</p> <p>"Old thief, where did you steal this from? No, wait&#8230; Are you bluffing? With that scrawny body of yours, there's no way you could lift this thing!"</p> <p>He walked up to the Demon-Subduing Vajra Staff and ran his fingers over its surface.</p> <p>The staff was smooth to the touch, its surface cool.</p> <p>The moment his hand made contact, the golden rings hanging from the staff began to sway.</p> <p>Ding ding ding&#8230;</p> <p>A clearer, more melodic chime rang out, making Sun Sheng jump in surprise.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun strutted over with an air of pride, placing a hand on the staff.</p> <p>"Kid, I snatched this from the chief escort of the Zhenyuan Escort Agency."</p> <p>He patted the staff, causing another series of crisp chimes to echo through the air.</p> <p>"This Demon-Subduing Vajra Staff is one of the sacred treasures of Shaolin Temple. It holds the power to subdue demons and was the weapon of the head of the Damo Hall. Anywhere in the world, this thing is worth a fortune!"</p> <p>Nan Yiyun looked at Sun Sheng triumphantly, fully expecting admiration and awe.</p> <p>Sun Sheng, however, simply rolled his eyes.</p> <p>"I'm leaving."</p> <p>With that, he turned and walked away.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun panicked.</p> <p>"Kid, shouldn't you at least say something?"</p> <p>His face flushed red, as if he'd just performed an amazing feat only for no one to acknowledge it.</p> <p>Sun Sheng suddenly smacked his forehead, as if remembering something.</p> <p>He turned back and shot Nan Yiyun a fierce glare.</p> <p>"The next time I catch you, I'm gonna beat you up!"</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Hearing Sun Sheng&#8217;s words, Nan Yiyun nearly passed out from rage.</p> <p>&#8220;You! You brat! A rotten piece of wood cannot be carved!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng completely ignored him, turning around and leaving without hesitation.</p> <p>He wasn&#8217;t stupid&#8212;he had already figured out that this old beggar was no ordinary man.</p> <p>&#8220;Kid!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun saw that Sun Sheng was really about to leave without looking back and hurriedly called out.</p> <p>Taking a deep breath, he leaped a full ten feet into the air and landed directly in front of Sun Sheng.</p> <p>A sharp glint flashed in Sun Sheng&#8217;s eyes. He curled his fist with a mocking smile that didn&#8217;t quite reach his eyes.</p> <p>&#8220;What? You wanna get punched?&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun straightened up, his face serious.</p> <p>&#8220;Kid, I like your style. Take me as your master. I&#8217;ll teach you top-tier martial arts!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng didn&#8217;t even think about it&#8212;he just rolled his eyes and stepped around Nan Yiyun.</p> <p>&#8220;No thanks! I already have a master.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eyes widened. He grabbed Sun Sheng&#8217;s arm.</p> <p>&#8220;Damn it, do I have to beg you to accept me as your master?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng had just started exerting force to break free when an immense strength surged from the old beggar&#8217;s grip, locking him in place like an iron vice.</p> <p>Fury ignited in Sun Sheng&#8217;s eyes. He immediately swung his left fist, landing a direct punch to Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eye socket.</p> <p>&#8220;You old bastard, let go of me!&#8221;</p> <p>The punch left Nan Yiyun momentarily stunned.</p> <p>His body trembled with rage, his teeth grinding audibly.</p> <p>He had roamed the martial world for decades, always the one beating others down, bullying them&#8212;when had he ever been the one getting bullied?</p> <p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s your master? Say the name. If he&#8217;s stronger than me, I&#8217;ll turn around and leave.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun was so pissed he even forgot his own principles, unknowingly using internal force on Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Sun Sheng sneered. &#8220;My master is Li Da.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Li Da? Who&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;A fisherman from Nanhe.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun froze at the answer, his face instantly turning red.</p> <p>White steam seemed to rise from his forehead.</p> <p>&#8220;Damn it! A stinking fisherman?!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng smirked coldly. &#8220;So what if he&#8217;s a fisherman? At least I&#8217;ll have a way to make a living. Now let go of me, or I won&#8217;t be polite.&#8221;</p> <p>His voice was sharp, full of warning.</p> <p>&#8220;You! You&#8212;&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun nearly jumped in frustration.</p> <p>As a grandmaster, he had countless people lining up to beg him for apprenticeship.</p> <p>And now, when he finally found a disciple he liked, the brat dared to compare him to a fisherman?</p> <p>A fisherman?!</p> <p>That was nothing! Not even worthy of carrying his shoes!</p> <p>Nan Yiyun trembled all over.</p> <p>Just as he was about to explode, his gaze shifted toward the woods south of town.</p> <p>In the distance, seven fast horses burst out from the dense forest.</p> <p>Three women and four men rode them, galloping swiftly toward Yuhang County.</p> <p>Wherever they passed, birds scattered in fright, and even the cicadas fell silent.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun glanced at the seven riders and let out a disdainful snort.</p> <p>They were too focused on their journey to notice him and Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Sun Sheng followed his gaze.</p> <p>The distance was a bit too far, so all he could make out were their silhouettes.</p> <p>Among them, one petite female figure caught his attention.</p> <p>Just from her back, he could tell&#8212;she was definitely not bad-looking.</p> <p>He clicked his tongue twice.</p> <p>&#8220;Stop staring. They&#8217;re all assassins.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s anger had mostly dissipated thanks to the distraction.</p> <p>Sun Sheng shot him a sideways glance.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun saw that look and immediately felt his temper flaring up again.</p> <p>&#8220;What do you even know?!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Let me go already!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng yanked his arm, but it was still held firmly.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun huffed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know a damn thing. Those seven are rushing through the forest, scaring birds and silencing insects&#8212;that&#8217;s the killing aura leaking off them.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Six of them are second-rank experts, and one is third-rank. They&#8217;re most likely remnants of the Fengyu Tower, with blood on their hands.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;If someone like you provoked them, you wouldn&#8217;t even know how you died.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun spat the words out impatiently.</p> <p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that got to do with me? Let me go! Don&#8217;t make me use force!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng was just as hot-tempered and had no patience for this annoying old beggar.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun jabbed a finger at him twice and then suddenly sneered.</p> <p>&#8220;A few days ago, you drank my Five Aggregates Spirit-Calming Wine. You don&#8217;t practice internal martial arts, so all the medicinal power is stuck in your belly.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Take a few deep breaths. See if your dantian feels a slight swelling, and if there&#8217;s a wave of heat rising from it?&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng&#8217;s expression shifted.</p> <p>Without a word, he took a deep breath, focusing on his dantian.</p> <p>A moment later, his face paled, his eyes filled with shock.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun's face twisted into a wicked grin.</p> <p>In the next instant, Sun Sheng slammed his fist right into Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eye socket.</p> <p>&#8220;Ow! What the hell are you doing, kid?!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun yelped.</p> <p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m gonna die anyway, I might as well get a few punches in on you first, you old bastard!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng was furious, his teeth clenched, his eyes slightly red.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grabbed Sun Sheng&#8217;s left hand and said, &#8220;Who said you were gonna die?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng froze.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun, exasperated, continued, &#8220;Your body is full of the wine&#8217;s medicinal power. If you train in my martial arts, you&#8217;ll progress at twice the speed. In no time, you&#8217;ll develop internal energy.&#8221;</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng&#8217;s face turned red.</p> <p>He had thought he was poisoned.</p> <p>With a cold snort, he retorted, &#8220;Not interested.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s right hand shot out, clamping around Sun Sheng&#8217;s throat.</p> <p>&#8220;Breathe in.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng had no choice&#8212;Nan Yiyun tapped a pressure point, and he instinctively took a deep breath.</p> <p>Smack!</p> <p>Nan Yiyun tightened his grip on Sun Sheng&#8217;s throat.</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s face immediately turned red&#8212;he couldn&#8217;t breathe.</p> <p>He raised his hands and struck Nan Yiyun&#8217;s body, trying to fight back.</p> <p>But he had no strength left. His blows were weak, barely landing with any force.</p> <p>After more than ten breaths, Nan Yiyun&#8217;s expression shifted slightly, and he finally let go.</p> <p>Sun Sheng collapsed to the ground, gasping for air, his face flushed, tears and snot streaming down his face.</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8230; damn&#8230; old bastard&#8230; were you trying&#8230; to kill me?!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Even if&#8230; you kill me&#8230; I won&#8217;t learn from you.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng wheezed and coughed, as if he had just come back from the brink of death.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun didn&#8217;t respond. His hands trembled slightly, his eyes filled with excitement.</p> <p>Suddenly, he threw his head back and laughed.</p> <p>&#8220;Hahaha! Excellent! Excellent!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng took a few more deep breaths to recover.</p> <p>Hearing Nan Yiyun&#8217;s manic laughter, he cursed in his heart.</p> <p>Madman!</p> <p>This guy is a total lunatic!</p> <p>Nan Yiyun crouched down, his gaze intense, staring straight at Sun Sheng.</p> <p>&#8220;Kid, what would it take for you to become my disciple?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You&#8217;re out of your damn mind!&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng pushed himself off the ground, lifted his chin, and snapped, &#8220;Old bastard, if you wanna kill me, just get it over with! Give me a quick death. If I even frown a little, I&#8217;ll call you my father!&#8221;</p> <p>By now, Sun Sheng had realized&#8212;he&#8217;d been targeted by this crazy old man.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun forced out an awkward smile, trying to soothe him.</p> <p>&#8220;Come on now, no need to get worked up. I&#8230; I&#8217;ve assessed your potential. You&#8217;re the perfect candidate to be my successor. So tell me, do you want treasures from the imperial palace? Or Wudang&#8217;s sacred artifacts? If I can get it, I&#8217;ll bring it to you.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng snorted. &#8220;Get my ass! Fine, I&#8217;ll be your disciple&#8212;if you kowtow to me three times first.&#8221;</p> <p>He was beyond furious at this point, feeling the urge to kick this old beggar to death.</p> <p>The moment the words left his mouth&#8212;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun didn&#8217;t hesitate for even a second.</p> <p>Thud!</p> <p>He dropped to his knees and knocked his forehead against the ground three times.</p> <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p> <p>Finishing the bows, Nan Yiyun looked up at Sun Sheng, eyes full of anticipation.</p> <p>&#8220;Is that good enough? Can I be your master now?&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng stood there, frozen.</p> <p>He swallowed hard, muttering,</p> <p>&#8220;Old bastard&#8230; you&#8217;re actually serious?!&#8221;</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>South of Yuhang County.</p> <p>Xiao Lian and her group of seven dismounted from their horses.</p> <p>After several days of rest, their wounds had mostly healed.</p> <p>However, their faces still carried the exhaustion of their long journey.</p> <p>After paying the entrance fee, the seven of them entered Yuhang County.</p> <p>The streets were bustling with people.</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to see the Direc&#8212;uh, Grandmaster. Master, you and the others should go find an inn and rest first,&#8221; Xiao Lian said, leading her horse and turning to the rest of the group.</p> <p>Qin Yi nodded slightly, her tone indifferent. &#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San, Chen Er, Zhou Ba, and the others also nodded in agreement.</p> <p>That night, the sight of Chen Ye crushing Monk Qingyuan&#8217;s skull was still deeply imprinted in their minds.</p> <p>When it came to Chen Ye, they felt an instinctive fear from the bottom of their hearts.</p> <p>A Grandmaster.</p> <p>How many Grandmasters existed in the entire world?</p> <p>They were merely second-rank martial artists. Compared to a Grandmaster, the gap was as vast as that between a beggar and an emperor.</p> <p>Xiao Lian gave a slight nod, handing her reins to Qian Qi before clasping her fists and leaving.</p> <p>Watching Xiao Lian&#8217;s figure disappear down the street, Qian Qi let out a sigh of relief and muttered, &#8220;Qin Yi, you really know how to pick disciples.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You just randomly found someone, and she turns out to have a Grandmaster backing her! How the hell did you manage that? Teach me your ways.&#8221;</p> <p>Qin Yi gave Qian Qi a flat glance and said nothing.</p> <p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s go. We&#8217;ve been traveling for days. Let&#8217;s find an inn and rest,&#8221; said the burly Chen Er, grinning. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been eating dry rations this whole time, and I haven&#8217;t had a single drop of wine.&#8221;</p> <p>Zhou Ba shook his head, swaying slightly as he said, &#8220;Wine alone isn&#8217;t enough. We need meat too.&#8221;</p> <p>He Wu clicked his tongue twice. &#8220;Look at you bunch&#8212;only thinking about food.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I heard there&#8217;s a Yihong Brothel in Yuhang County. Is that true?&#8221;</p> <p>The moment he said this, Chen Er, Zhou Ba, and Qian Qi all shot him a look of disdain.</p> <p>&#8220;What? You guys can eat, but I can't indulge a little?&#8221; He Wu scoffed. &#8220;Bunch of hypocrites.&#8221;</p> <p>Huang San, who had a black saber strapped to his waist and a blade of grass in his mouth, said lazily, &#8220;If the Grandmaster summons us later, we&#8217;ll be sure to tell him everything.&#8221;</p> <p>At those words, He Wu immediately shut up.</p> <p>If the Grandmaster called for them and he was off visiting a brothel, that would leave a terrible impression, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p> <p>Forget it. The brothel would always be there.</p> <p>He couldn't afford to mess up something important.</p> <p>With that, the six of them stepped into the Yuelai Inn.</p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>Xiao Lian stood before the entrance, staring at the five large characters above&#8212;Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>It had only been a little over twenty days since she last left, yet now that she is back&#8230;</p> <p>Her feelings were completely different from when she had departed.</p> <p>She never would have imagined that Chen Ye&#8212;lazy, always basking in the sun, reading idle books&#8212;was actually a Grandmaster.</p> <p>Her bright eyes lingered on the signboard for a moment before she took a deep breath and stepped inside.</p> <p>Chen Ye, lounging on a recliner, heard the movement and set down his book.</p> <p>Seeing Xiao Lian, he smiled warmly. &#8220;You&#8217;re back?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Director.&#8221;</p> <p>Seeing that familiar, handsome face, Xiao Lian finally felt at ease.</p> <p>&#8220;Have you eaten?&#8221; Chen Ye rose from his recliner and placed his book to the side.</p> <p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p> <p>Her delicate face still bore traces of exhaustion from the long journey.</p> <p>&#8220;In that case, go rest for now.&#8221; Chen Ye&#8217;s smile was bright and soothing. &#8220;We&#8217;ll eat when Da Ming gets back.&#8221;</p> <p>Suddenly, something came to mind, and he added, &#8220;Oh, right. While you were away, we took in another orphan.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;His name is Sun Sheng. Smart kid, quick on his feet. He&#8217;s a good one.&#8221;</p> <p>Another orphan&#8230;</p> <p>Xiao Lian let out a soft hum of acknowledgment, her lips curving into a small smile.</p> <p>&#8220;One more thing&#8212;outside, you&#8217;re an assassin of the Jade Leaf Hall, but when you&#8217;re home, you&#8217;re just Xiao Lian.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell Da Ming or the others about your identity. They&#8217;re just ordinary people. Don&#8217;t drag them into this.&#8221; Chen Ye&#8217;s tone was calm.</p> <p>Xiao Lian obediently nodded.</p> <p>With that, Chen Ye grinned. &#8220;I&#8217;ll head to the kitchen and start preparing. You should go check on Xiaofu.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;That little kid really missed you while you were gone.&#8221;</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s smile disappeared instantly.</p> <p>She puffed out her cheeks, looking completely disgruntled.</p> <p>Seeing her reaction, Chen Ye burst out laughing and dusted his backside before heading to the kitchen.</p> <p>Finally&#8212;after these past few days&#8212;he could finally relax a little.</p> <p>Watching Chen Ye&#8217;s leisurely retreating figure, Xiao Lian was momentarily lost in thought.</p> <p>Director&#8230;</p> <p>He&#8217;s such a strange person.</p> <p>He was an amazing cook. He always had weird, fascinating things. And he was a Grandmaster.</p> <p>If he wanted, he could be the most powerful, most influential person in the martial world.</p> <p>Yet here he was, running an orphanage in Yuhang County&#8230;</p> <p>Xiao Lian couldn&#8217;t understand his reasoning.</p> <p>But she respected him deeply.</p> <p>Not just for his martial prowess but from the depths of her heart.</p> <p>Watching his back as he entered the kitchen, a touch of reverence appeared in her gaze.</p> <p>She turned back around&#8212;</p> <p>And suddenly, her body stiffened.</p> <p>By the window&#8212;</p> <p>A pair of round, black eyes blinked at her.</p> <p>The next moment, the little child&#8217;s lips curled into a sweet, innocent smile.</p> <p>&#8220;Lian&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>The child&#8217;s voice was soft and milky as she called her name.</p> <p>Xiaofu called out in her soft, childlike voice.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>"You old bastard&#8230; you actually did it!"</p> <p>Sun Sheng looked at the old beggar kneeling on the ground, having just finished kowtowing three times. He was completely at a loss.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun gazed at Sun Sheng with burning eyes.</p> <p>&#8220;Well? I&#8217;ve done what you asked.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng opened his mouth but had no words.</p> <p>He had only spoken in anger.</p> <p>Who would have thought that the old beggar would actually take it seriously?</p> <p>But a man of honor never goes back on his word.</p> <p>In this world, one&#8217;s credibility was everything.</p> <p>After a brief hesitation, Sun Sheng gritted his teeth and said, &#8220;Alright!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;This young master will acknowledge you as my teacher, but I only kneel to the heavens above and my parents below&#8212;not to you.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun waved his hand dismissively. &#8220;No matter. Formalities are meaningless! I&#8217;ve never cared for society&#8217;s pointless customs.&#8221;</p> <p>After saying this, Nan Yiyun looked at Sun Sheng with satisfaction.</p> <p>&#8220;Good. Very good. You&#8217;re just like me when I was young&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>His gaze toward Sun Sheng was like that of an appraiser admiring a rare treasure.</p> <p>&#8220;In fact, your aptitude is even better than mine.&#8221;</p> <p>Feeling the old beggar&#8217;s fiery gaze, Sun Sheng got goosebumps.</p> <p>&#8220;Hurry up and spit it out! This young master is busy!&#8221; He snapped.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grinned. &#8220;Alright, my dear disciple. I&#8217;ll recite our internal cultivation technique for you to memorize.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The martial art of our lineage is called Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique&#8212;the sacred treasure of the Nanhai Sect, a true innate-level technique.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Once mastered, your internal energy will stack continuously, flowing like an unending tide. You&#8217;ll have the power to shatter mountains and sweep away the sea!&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;It embodies the force of a mighty ocean wave.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;But be warned&#8212;those with weak minds will have their spirits shattered upon first contact.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Our training differs from other sects. We don&#8217;t prioritize innate talent&#8212;only lung capacity.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;You, my disciple, have an exceptional lung capacity. You can hold your breath for dozens of seconds! This technique is a perfect match for you!&#8221;</p> <p>As Nan Yiyun spoke, he became increasingly excited, spittle flying everywhere.</p> <p>After listening for a few moments, Sun Sheng grew impatient and waved his hand. &#8220;Stop, stop! What the hell is all that? Just write it down for me.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun chuckled awkwardly but patiently explained, &#8220;Disciple, this is an innate-level technique. Even a single leaked page could plunge the martial world into chaos.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No writing? Then this young master is leaving.&#8221; Sun Sheng turned around without hesitation.</p> <p>&#8220;Hey, hey, hey! Fine, fine! I&#8217;ll write it down!&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun quickly pulled him back.</p> <p>&#8220;Then hurry up. I&#8217;m giving you fifteen minutes.&#8221;</p> <p>Sun Sheng squinted and sat cross-legged on the ground.</p> <p>&#8220;Alright, just wait here a moment. Your master will be right back.&#8221;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun took a deep breath, then leaped away, his figure vanishing toward Yuhang County in just a few bounds.</p> <p>Sun Sheng half-opened his eyes and saw Nan Yiyun&#8217;s silhouette flickering twenty or so zhang away in an instant. His heart trembled in shock.</p> <p>&#8220;Hiss&#8230; Did this young master really stumble upon a hidden master? Could I actually be this lucky?&#8221;</p> <p>Rubbing his chin, Sun Sheng fell into deep thought.</p> <p>&#8220;That technique he was bragging about sounds pretty impressive&#8230; I should take it back and show it to Foster Father.&#8221;</p> <p>Yuyu: This is the current situation of the Challenge goals

                            </p><p>"Just a few pages?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng held a few sheets of paper, the ink still wet, his face full of suspicion.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun plastered on a flattering smile. "Disciple, this is all there is to the technique. Memorize it well."</p> <p>"As for the training method, I will personally guide you."</p> <p>Sun Sheng rolled his eyes and stuffed the pages into his robe.</p> <p>"Yeah, yeah, I'll look at it when I have time. Right now, this young master is going home to eat."</p> <p>He waved his hand dismissively. "See ya."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun quickly grabbed his arm, his expression serious. "Disciple, you absolutely must not spread this technique to anyone. This is the sacred treasure of our Nanhai Sect."</p> <p>Sun Sheng paused mid-step, raising an eyebrow. "And what if I do?"</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s expression turned firm. "Absolutely not!"</p> <p>Sun Sheng arched his brow and made a move to pull the technique out of his robe.</p> <p>"Hey, hey, hey! Wait a minute&#8230;!" Nan Yiyun's face twisted in distress.</p> <p>Stopping him in a hurry, he hesitated before saying, "At least&#8230; at least tell me beforehand."</p> <p>Sun Sheng turned around and said, "I&#8217;m taking it back to show my Foster Father."</p> <p>"Got a problem with that?"</p> <p>"Your Foster Father? Who is he?" Nan Yiyun&#8217;s heart clenched.</p> <p>Sun Sheng's eyes flickered mischievously. "You just tell me&#8212;yes or no?"</p> <p>Saying that, he made a show of pulling out the pages again.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun quickly interjected, "Does your Foster Father know martial arts? Our sect's technique is unreadable to ordinary people. Without my personal guidance, he won&#8217;t be able to learn it anyway."</p> <p>Sun Sheng gave it some thought.</p> <p>His Foster Father&#8230; didn&#8217;t seem to practice martial arts, right?</p> <p>In his mind, Chen Ye was always lounging on a recliner after meals, reading books&#8212;never once had he seen him train.</p> <p>"Uh&#8230; just say yes or no already!" Sun Sheng snapped impatiently.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grimaced and, after a long pause, gritted his teeth. "Fine, he can read it. But if he dares to spread it, I will show no mercy!"</p> <p>Sun Sheng rolled his eyes and turned away.</p> <p>Listening to this old beggar talk about the technique like it was some divine scripture, he figured he might as well take it back for his Foster Father to check out.</p> <p>His father read books all day&#8212;maybe he'd actually understand it.</p> <p>He had been living at the orphanage for nearly a month now, barely doing any real work and freeloading off their meals.</p> <p>Since this old bastard was handing over the technique so willingly, he might as well gift it to his father.</p> <p>With a gourd of wine slung at his waist, Sun Sheng swaggered into the forest path, heading toward Yuhang County.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun watched his retreating figure and muttered, "Damn&#8230; his temper is just like mine when I was young. Master, who would&#8217;ve thought I'd one day have to beg someone to be my disciple?"</p> <p>He shook his head, both exasperated and relieved.</p> <p>Still, Sun Sheng's temperament suited him, and his talent was a perfect match for Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique.</p> <p>If his old injuries ever flared up again and took his life, at least the Nanhai Sect's lineage wouldn&#8217;t be lost.</p> <p>With that thought, Nan Yiyun turned back toward the Demon-Subduing Staff, contemplating how to deal with it.</p> <p>He pondered for a long time before suddenly snapping out of it.</p> <p>"To hell with those bald thieves! What the hell does losing the Shaolin treasure have to do with me?!"</p> <p>Laziness taking over, he yanked the Demon-Subduing Staff from the ground, its golden rings clanking.</p> <p>With a single-arm swing, he hurled it straight into the river.</p> <p>"BOOM!"</p> <p>A thunderous splash erupted as water shot several zhang into the air.</p> <p>Fish scattered in all directions, fleeing in panic.</p> <p>The golden staff slowly sank to the riverbed.</p> <p>Clapping the dust off his hands, Nan Yiyun turned and strolled toward Yuhang County.</p> <p>"Heh, heh, heh&#8230;"</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Humming a little tune, Sun Sheng strolled back to the orphanage.</p> <p>The moment he stepped into the courtyard, his body gave an involuntary shudder.</p> <p>Inside, a petite and delicate figure stood in the yard.</p> <p>From the silhouette alone, it was clear&#8212;it was a woman.</p> <p>And a beautiful one at that.</p> <p>She wasn&#8217;t very old either.</p> <p>Seeing her, a layer of cold sweat slowly formed on Sun Sheng&#8217;s forehead.</p> <p>Because he had seen this figure before&#8212;deep in the southern woods outside the city.</p> <p>Back then, he had only thought she had a strikingly graceful back.</p> <p>"Gulp&#8230;"</p> <p>His throat moved as he swallowed, body stiffening.</p> <p>After seeing Nan Yiyun&#8217;s display of martial arts, he was already seventy to eighty percent convinced by the old man&#8217;s words.</p> <p>And when those seven people passed through the forest earlier, the birds had scattered, and the cicadas had gone silent.</p> <p>She was an assassin!</p> <p>Who was she here to kill?</p> <p>Sun Sheng stood frozen in place, tense and alert.</p> <p>Just then&#8212;</p> <p>A tiny head suddenly peeked out from the woman's shoulder.</p> <p>Dark, glossy hair, a pair of big, round eyes, black and white distinct.</p> <p>Xiaofu let out two soft, incoherent sounds.</p> <p>"Sheng&#8230;" She mumbled clumsily.</p> <p>The woman turned around, revealing a soft smile when she saw Sun Sheng.</p> <p>"You must be Sun Sheng? I&#8217;ve heard the director mention you."</p> <p>In truth, the moment Sun Sheng had reached the orphanage gate, Xiao Lian had already noticed someone approaching.</p> <p>But the unfamiliar footstep pattern told her it wasn&#8217;t Da Ming.</p> <p>So, she guessed it was the newcomer Chen Ye had mentioned&#8212;Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Hearing her words, Sun Sheng blanked for a second.</p> <p>What&#8230; was happening?</p> <p>His brain momentarily failed to process the situation.</p> <p>"Xiao Sheng, this is your Sister Lian."</p> <p>Chen Ye stepped out of the kitchen with a smile, introducing her.</p> <p>"She&#8217;s a year older than you. When you first arrived, she was away on some errands. She just got back."</p> <p>Hearing Chen Ye&#8217;s introduction, Sun Sheng forced a stiff smile and awkwardly called out, "Sister Lian."</p> <p>"Mm." Xiao Lian responded with a faint, elegant smile.</p> <p>"Sheng&#8230;"</p> <p>Xiaofu stretched out her tiny arms, gazing at Sun Sheng with big, expectant eyes.</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s face brightened as she said, "Xiaofu wants you to hold her."</p> <p>Sun Sheng took a long, deep look at Xiao Lian, his smile still frozen in place as he walked forward to take Xiaofu into his arms.</p> <p>Holding the child gently, he soothed her in a soft voice.</p> <p>But his peripheral vision kept darting toward Xiao Lian.</p> <p>Damn&#8230;</p> <p>Foster Father, this Sister Lian is an assassin!</p> <p>Why is there someone like that in our orphanage?!</p> <p>A hint of unease crept into Sun Sheng&#8217;s heart.</p> <p>Did his Foster Father even know she was an assassin?</p> <p>If the authorities found out, there would be trouble.</p> <p>According to Dawu&#8217;s laws, harboring a criminal&#8212;especially a murderer&#8212;was a crime punishable by collective punishment!</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s expression darkened.</p> <p>His Foster Father, Da Ming, Xiaofu, and even himself&#8212;none of them were martial artists.</p> <p>If Sister Lian got caught by the authorities, they were all doomed.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Inside the kitchen, Xiao Lian was helping Chen Ye with food prep when she cast a sidelong glance toward the courtyard.</p> <p>"Director, Xiao Sheng just secretly glanced at me several times."</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled. "You&#8217;re such a pretty girl&#8212;it&#8217;s normal for him to steal a few glances."</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips slightly but didn&#8217;t say anything.</p> <p>Her eyes, however, grew noticeably colder.</p> <p>"Director, we&#8217;re running low on vegetables. I&#8217;ll go buy some more."</p> <p>"Go ahead. Oh, and get more eggs&#8212;Da Ming insists on having them every meal now."</p> <p>"Mm."</p> <p>Xiao Lian picked up the shopping basket and left the kitchen.</p> <p>In the courtyard, Sun Sheng saw her coming and put on a smile. "Sister Lian!"</p> <p>Xiao Lian&#8217;s face remained cool as she merely gave him a slight nod.</p> <p>Sun Sheng watched as she exited the orphanage, a chill creeping up his back.</p> <p>"What was that look just now? Was she&#8230; warning me?"</p> <p>Swallowing nervously, Sun Sheng suddenly felt a cold sweat break out on his skin.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>As the sun dipped below the horizon, it left a streak of crimson across the sky.</p> <p>Wisps of clouds were tinted with a gentle, intoxicating red by the sunset.</p> <p>At the orphanage&#8212;</p> <p>A large square table was set up in the courtyard, adorned with an array of carefully prepared dishes.</p> <p>Golden chicken soup, tender shrimp, vibrant stir-fried greens&#8230;</p> <p>The aroma was rich and tantalizing, stirring one's appetite.</p> <p>Beside the table sat a pot of freshly cooked rice.</p> <p>Chen Ye, Da Ming, Xiao Lian, Xiaofu, and Sun Sheng all gathered around the table.</p> <p>In front of each person was a bowl and chopsticks, the porcelain bowls filled with steaming rice, each grain plump and glistening.</p> <p>"Today, our Yuhang Orphanage is finally complete. That calls for a little celebration."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled as he looked at each of them&#8212;Da Ming, Xiao Lian, Xiaofu, and Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Da Ming grinned foolishly, eyes gleaming with happiness.</p> <p>Xiao Lian pursed her lips into a gentle smile, her bright eyes resting on Chen Ye.</p> <p>Sun Sheng, with his fair and handsome features, flashed a grin as silly as Da Ming&#8217;s.</p> <p>"We&#8212;"</p> <p>"Ah, Xiaofu, don&#8217;t pull my ear!"</p> <p>Just as Chen Ye was about to say something, Xiaofu crawled onto his lap, her chubby little hands latching onto his ear.</p> <p>Chen Ye grimaced, caught between amusement and helplessness.</p> <p>The other three chuckled at the sight.</p> <p>The tension in the air melted away instantly.</p> <p>"Alright, alright, let&#8217;s eat. Director won&#8217;t say anything more&#8212;Not even allowed to enjoy a moment of being an esteemed official, huh?"</p> <p>Chen Ye waved his hand with a laugh, signaling everyone to start eating.</p> <p>His expression was warm as he settled Xiaofu onto his lap.</p> <p>He picked up a tender shrimp with his chopsticks and brought it to her lips.</p> <p>"Here, Xiaofu, have some shrimp."</p> <p>Xiaofu blinked her big, round eyes and bit down on the chopstick&#8217;s tip.</p> <p>With a single slurp, the shrimp disappeared into her mouth.</p> <p>For a moment, she chewed thoughtfully&#8212;then her brows furrowed.</p> <p>The shrimp came back out, perfectly intact, landing straight onto Chen Ye&#8217;s clothes.</p> <p>Chen Ye: &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p> <p>The others burst into laughter.</p> <p>Shaking his head, Chen Ye muttered a playful curse and picked another dish for Xiaofu.</p> <p>The meal continued in harmony, filled with laughter and chatter.</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>After dinner&#8212;</p> <p>Xiao Lian took Xiaofu out for a stroll, Da Ming carried a bucket off to fetch water, and Sun Sheng followed Chen Ye into the kitchen to wash the dishes.</p> <p>As soon as Chen Ye dipped his hands into the water, Sun Sheng sneaked up beside him, looking rather suspicious.</p> <p>In his left hand, he held a wine gourd. With his right, he pulled out a few crumpled pages from his chest pocket.</p> <p>"Foster Father, today an old beggar knelt down and begged me to take him as my master. I&#8230; uh, borrowed this wine and these pages from him. The wine, he claimed, is top-grade Shaoxing Yellow Wine, worth ten taels of silver per jug. And these pages&#8212;he said they contain powerful martial arts techniques. You&#8217;re well-read, so you&#8217;ll definitely understand them."</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s face showed a mix of gratitude and embarrassment as he added, "I&#8217;ve been eating and drinking here for free since I arrived&#8230; Take a look and see if they&#8217;re useful."</p> <p>Chen Ye pulled his hands from the water, wiping them dry on a cloth.</p> <p>He frowned slightly, giving Sun Sheng a glance before taking the wine gourd, inspecting it briefly, and setting it aside.</p> <p>His focus then shifted to the few pages of messy handwriting.</p> <p>After a few moments of scanning the contents&#8212;</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s expression turned&#8230; odd.</p> <p>He looked up at Sun Sheng.</p> <p>"Xiao Sheng, you said that old beggar knelt down and begged you to be his disciple?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng nodded vigorously, scoffing.</p> <p>"That old bastard had no dignity at all. Just a spineless old fool. I&#8230; used a little trick, and he handed these pages over with both hands. So, Foster Father, what do you think? Is this stuff useful?"</p> <p>Chen Ye was momentarily speechless.</p> <p>Useful? That was an understatement.</p> <p>He lowered his head, staring at the pages in his hands.</p> <p>This technique&#8230; was just like the Innate Qi Technique that Qing Xuzi had given him.</p> <p>It was a Grandmaster-level martial art!</p> <p>Chen Ye couldn't help but inwardly complain&#8212;</p> <p>What kind of ridiculous luck did Sun Sheng have?</p> <p>A Grandmaster-level expert actually knelt before him, begging to take him as a disciple, and even gifted him a martial art manual?!</p> <p>Even the so-called "Chosen Ones" weren&#8217;t this lucky, were they?</p> <p>Chen Ye carefully examined the technique.</p> <p>With his foundation in Innate Qi Technique, he immediately noticed the unique qualities of this manual.</p> <p>Judging from its contents, this technique was fundamentally different from other internal cultivation methods.</p> <p>Each time it was practiced, it could only generate an exceptionally tiny strand of internal energy.</p> <p>That strand wouldn&#8217;t merge with others over time, nor form a unified flow. Instead, it would accumulate in the dantian as individual strands.</p> <p>After years of accumulation, the practitioner would have countless strands of internal energy stored within.</p> <p>However, this method didn&#8217;t allow for energy projection in battle. Instead, it had its own specialized striking technique.</p> <p>And this striking method was quite ingenious&#8212;</p> <p>By channeling internal energy in a precise manner, the countless individual strands of power could be activated simultaneously, creating a resonant effect.</p> <p>The result?</p> <p>A force as mighty as raging waves, capable of turning the ordinary into something divine.</p> <p>Finishing his read-through, Chen Ye realized something&#8212;</p> <p>Unlike Daoist internal techniques like the Innate Qi Technique, which relied on a person&#8217;s natural talent for internal energy, this technique didn&#8217;t care about aptitude at all.</p> <p>It only cared about how long one could persist in training!</p> <p>In an instant, Chen Ye grasped the true value of this martial art.</p> <p>No need for talent&#8212;just accumulate long enough, and you could achieve Grandmaster-level combat power!</p> <p>If word of this spread in the martial world, it would ignite a bloodbath.</p> <p>Chen Ye was stunned.</p> <p>Whoever created this technique was nothing short of a genius.</p> <p>"What&#8217;s the name of this technique?"</p> <p>Chen Ye looked at Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Sun Sheng scratched his head, thinking. "I think it&#8217;s called the Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique."</p> <p>"Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves&#8230;"</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded slightly, eyes filled with contemplation.</p> <p>The name fit perfectly.</p> <p>Accumulating thousands&#8212;even tens of thousands&#8212;of strands of energy, then unleashing them like a tidal wave in battle.</p> <p>Now, a question arose in his mind&#8212;</p> <p>Could the striking method of this technique be applied to his Innate Qi Technique?</p> <p>The Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique used tiny strands of internal energy but could still produce Grandmaster-level power.</p> <p>If he converted the method to work with his Innate Qi Technique, which generated limitless, purer energy&#8230;</p> <p>The difference in quality between a single strand of Innate Qi and a strand of internal energy was like the difference between heaven and earth.</p> <p>Chen Ye took a sharp breath.</p> <p>Even he was startled by the implications.</p> <p>If this really worked&#8230;</p> <p>A spark of excitement flickered in his eyes.</p> <p>He wouldn&#8217;t just be practicing martial arts anymore.</p> <p>He&#8217;d be stepping into the realm of immortals.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Chen Ye carefully folded the manual and returned it to Sun Sheng.</p> <p>"Xiao Sheng, this technique is incredibly valuable. The old man who passed it to you genuinely cares about you. Without his permission, don&#8217;t show it to anyone else. If you meet him again, show him some respect."</p> <p>Chen Ye did not accept the manual.</p> <p>Because he knew exactly how much it was worth.</p> <p>This was a priceless treasure.</p> <p>Something that could drive the entire martial world into madness.</p> <p>And precisely because of that, Chen Ye felt the weight of the old man&#8217;s regard for Sun Sheng.</p> <p>The man was known as the "South Sea Phantom".</p> <p>Even though this technique might be useful to Chen Ye, he didn&#8217;t want to obtain it this way.</p> <p>Sun Sheng took back the Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique, a hint of confusion on his fair and handsome face.</p> <p>"Is it really that powerful?"</p> <p>Chen Ye dipped his hands back into the wooden basin and resumed scrubbing dishes.</p> <p>"Yes. Very powerful."</p> <p>Sun Sheng stuffed the manual back into his chest pocket and helped pick up the dishes.</p> <p>"Before I left, I actually asked that old bastard about it. He said I could show it to you."</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled.</p> <p>"That was just a casual remark. To anyone who recognizes its worth, this technique is priceless."</p> <p>Sun Sheng fell into thought.</p> <p>He glanced at Chen Ye, an idea forming in his mind.</p> <p>Could it be&#8230;?</p> <p>Did his Foster Father know martial arts?</p> <p>But&#8230; he didn&#8217;t look like a martial artist at all.</p> <p>Sun Sheng pondered for a moment but couldn&#8217;t come to a conclusion.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>The two of them finished washing the dishes together. Chen Ye wiped his hands and said, "Xiao Sheng, come here. I have something to talk to you about."</p> <p>"Oh, okay."</p> <p>Sun Sheng quickly put away the remaining dishes and utensils before following Chen Ye out of the kitchen.</p> <p>Chen Ye walked into the courtyard and said casually, "Bring out two chairs."</p> <p>Sun Sheng ran inside, grabbed two chairs, and brought them out.</p> <p>He placed one behind Chen Ye and the other behind himself.</p> <p>"Sit down," Chen Ye gestured for him to take a seat. Then, fixing his gaze on Sun Sheng, he spoke, "Xiaosheng, since you call me your Foster Father&#8230; I must take responsibility."</p> <p>Hearing this, Sun Sheng obediently sat down, his expression turning serious.</p> <p>Noticing his nervousness, Chen Ye smiled faintly. "We're just having a chat."</p> <p>Sun Sheng grinned sheepishly, his smile as honest as the bright Ming Sun.</p> <p>Chen Ye looked toward the darkening sky and asked, "Xiao Sheng, what kind of person do you want to become in the future?"</p> <p>A hint of confusion flickered in Sun Sheng&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>"Or rather, do you want to be a good person or a bad one?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng scratched his head and chuckled shyly. "Of course, I want to be a good person."</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded lightly, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon.</p> <p>"But sometimes, the line between good and bad isn't so clear-cut. A good person can be a bad person, and a bad person can be a good one."</p> <p>Sun Sheng&#8217;s eyes showed a trace of uncertainty.</p> <p>"There are too many paths in this world. You can choose to be a bad person, or you can choose to be a good one. The kind of person you become depends entirely on your own choices. But as your father, I only hope that no matter what you do, you never betray your own heart."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled faintly as he looked up at the dusky purple sky. "Because in this world, there is no absolute good or absolute evil."</p> <p>Turning his gaze back to Sun Sheng, he spoke gently, "So before you act, always take a moment to think."</p> <p>"Do you understand?"</p> <p>Sun Sheng seemed deep in thought. The confusion in his eyes gradually faded.</p> <p>He nodded solemnly, his expression respectful. "I understand."</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled faintly.</p> <p>The evening breeze swept through.</p> <p>Leaves rustled softly.</p> <p>The cool night air carried a sense of peace throughout the courtyard.</p> <p>Chen Ye was not someone who enjoyed preaching.</p> <p>He also didn&#8217;t believe that lectures alone could change a person.</p> <p>But today, he made an exception for Sun Sheng.</p> <p>Sun Sheng was different from Da Ming and Xiao Lian&#8212;he carried a lot of street smarts from growing up in the city.</p> <p>Moreover, the path he had chosen in his heart&#8230; was that of a water bandit.</p> <p>And that worried Chen Ye.</p> <p>A bandit&#8230; was still a bandit in the end.</p> <p>Chen Ye gazed at the distant, misty green mountains, his eyes growing darker and deeper.</p> <p>The night stretched on.</p> <p>A waning moon hung in the sky, casting its cold, silvery glow.</p> <p>Deep into the night, every household had already drifted into slumber.</p> <p>Occasionally, the distant barking of dogs broke the silence, making the night feel even stiller.</p> <p>On a certain residential house, lying on the rooftop, Nan Yiyun suddenly yawned.</p> <p>With bleary, half-opened eyes, he stretched lazily before sitting up.</p> <p>A thin strand of drool clung to the corner of his mouth, and his face was still clouded with the confusion of just waking up.</p> <p>Looking up at the waning moon, he murmured, "Midnight already?"</p> <p>"Gurgle&#8230;"</p> <p>His stomach let out a pitiful growl.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grimaced, smacking his lips. "That brat sure enjoyed his dinner. He didn't even think to save a bite for his master!"</p> <p>He yawned again.</p> <p>Just the memory of seeing Sun Sheng and the others feasting at sunset had him drooling uncontrollably.</p> <p>"I have no idea how they cook, but that color and aroma! Even the imperial dishes in Bianliang&#8217;s palace couldn&#8217;t compare."</p> <p>Swallowing hungrily, Nan Yiyun flipped off the roof beam and darted in a particular direction, muttering under his breath, "Hope they left something behind&#8230;"</p> <p>&#8230;&#160;</p> <p>Yuhang Orphanage.</p> <p>Sitting cross-legged on his bed, controlling the innate energy within him, Chen Ye suddenly opened his eyes.</p> <p>A strange look crossed his face.</p> <p>"Someone is actually trying to steal from an orphanage?"</p> <p>He got off the bed, gently pushed open the door, and made his way toward the kitchen.</p> <p>"Creak&#8230;"</p> <p>Just as Chen Ye pushed open the kitchen door, he felt several acupoints on his body being sealed.</p> <p>At the same time, a low mutter reached his ears.</p> <p>"Damn it, scared the hell out of me! What are you doing in the kitchen at this hour instead of sleeping?"</p> <p>Nan Yiyun grumbled in annoyance.</p> <p>He had just snuck into the kitchen when the orphanage director followed right behind him, giving him quite the fright.</p> <p>For a moment, he thought he had been caught.</p> <p>But then again&#8230; who besides a grandmaster could possibly detect his presence?</p> <p>Clicking his tongue, Nan Yiyun sealed Chen Ye&#8217;s acupoints and mumbled a few complaints before turning to rummage through the kitchen.</p> <p>"Weird. Where&#8217;s the leftovers?"</p> <p>"No way they ate everything."</p> <p>"There was so much food this afternoon. How could it all be gone?"</p> <p>The more he searched, the more frustrated he became.</p> <p>Just then&#8212;</p> <p>A voice suddenly spoke behind him.</p> <p>"Dinner&#8217;s all gone. But if you&#8217;re hungry, I can make you something."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun shuddered violently on the spot.</p> <p>"Who's there?!" He inhaled sharply, his voice tense.</p> <p>On a silent, pitch-black night, if someone suddenly spoke right behind you, anyone would be startled.</p> <p>Even Nan Yiyun wasn&#8217;t immune to it.</p> <p>He was certain there had been no one else around&#8212;except for the orphanage director, whose acupoints he had sealed the moment he entered.</p> <p>Then&#8230; who had just spoken?</p> <p>Footsteps echoed in the kitchen.</p> <p>"Snap."</p> <p>A flint was struck.</p> <p>In the next moment, a small flame flickered to life, pushing back the darkness.</p> <p>By the light of the fire, Nan Yiyun finally saw who had spoken.</p> <p>His eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>Because it was none other than the orphanage director&#8212;the very man whose acupoints he had sealed upon entering.</p> <p>Chen Ye held a piece of tinder, using it to light the kitchen&#8217;s oil lamp.</p> <p>A wisp of blue smoke curled upward as the flame flickered to life, casting a soft, steady glow.</p> <p>Under the warm lamplight, Chen Ye stood tall in his white robes, holding the lamp in one hand while smiling at Nan Yiyun.</p> <p>"If you're hungry, you can wait a moment," he said.</p> <p>The flickering light cast shadows over his sharp, handsome features, giving him an air of quiet mystery.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun stared at him, dumbfounded.</p> <p>"What the hell? Did I misjudged him?"</p> <p>"Never thought a mere orphanage would have a first-rank expert&#8230;"</p> <p>In his eyes, someone who could move freely after having their acupoints sealed had to be, at the very least, a first-rank martial artist.</p> <p>As for a grandmaster?</p> <p>Impossible.</p> <p>There were only five grandmasters in the entire world, and this young man wasn&#8217;t among them.</p> <p>Realizing he had been exposed, Nan Yiyun made himself comfortable, swaggering over to sit on a long wooden bench.</p> <p>He propped one foot up on the bench, lazily squinting at Chen Ye.</p> <p>"Kid, make me something to eat," he said, completely unfazed. "If you serve me well, I might even feel generous enough to teach you a move or two."</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>Chen Ye smiled faintly, setting the oil lamp down as he took a seat across from Nan Yiyun.</p> <p>"I&#8217;ll cook something for you. But in exchange, I want the Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s lips curled into a cold smile. He lowered the leg he had propped up on the bench.</p> <p>"Kid, do you even know what you're asking for?"</p> <p>Chen Ye spoke calmly, "The few pages in Xiao Sheng&#8217;s possession only contain the mental cultivation method, not the internal energy training techniques."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s expression turned serious. "So, you&#8217;re Sun Sheng&#8217;s adoptive father?"</p> <p>"That&#8217;s right."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s face twisted into a complicated expression.</p> <p>That little bastard... &#8216;He just got the manual from me, and the first thing he does is give it away?&#8217;</p> <p>A surge of irritation welled up in his chest.</p> <p>Suppressing his frustration, he lowered his voice. "Kid, these are my rules. Fight me. If you can beat me, the Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique is yours."</p> <p>"Is that a promise?" Chen Ye&#8217;s face remained calm as he gazed at Nan Yiyun.</p> <p>He had been wanting to test a grandmaster&#8217;s strength.</p> <p>See if they were even worthy of carrying his shoes.</p> <p>"A gentleman&#8217;s word is as firm as four galloping horses."</p> <p>As soon as Nan Yiyun finished speaking, his body shifted, and his right palm shot forward.</p> <p>"Wait."</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s indifferent voice cut through the tension.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun frowned. "What? Regretting it already? Too late now!"</p> <p>"Let&#8217;s take this outside. I don&#8217;t want my furniture getting wrecked." Chen Ye smiled lightly.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun let out a cold laugh. "Kid, you sure think highly of yourself, don&#8217;t you?"</p> <p>Chen Ye didn&#8217;t respond. He simply picked up the oil lamp and walked away.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun narrowed his eyes.</p> <p>This kid&#8230;</p> <p>So composed, so confident, as if victory was already in his grasp.</p> <p>Where the hell did he come from?</p> <p>So young, yet already at first-rank strength, hiding away in a tiny orphanage?</p> <p>A first-rank expert could be the head of a major sect!</p> <p>Nan Yiyun scoffed. "Like hell I&#8217;d be afraid of you!"</p> <p>The two stepped out of the orphanage and onto the long street.</p> <p>The night was deep.</p> <p>A lone crescent moon hung in the dark sky.</p> <p>Its cold silver light spilled across the street, bathing the ground in a shimmering glow.</p> <p>Chen Ye, unhurried, placed the oil lamp to the side.</p> <p>A breeze swept by, making the small flame flicker.</p> <p>"Woof! Woof!"</p> <p>From a distant house, a few dogs barked.</p> <p>Chen Ye stood tall, his shadow stretching long across the moonlit ground.</p> <p>His expression was serene, his gaze fathomless.</p> <p>He raised his right hand, palm facing the moon.</p> <p>His fingers curled slightly, beckoning Nan Yiyun to attack.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun was so infuriated that he actually laughed.</p> <p>"Kid, acting all high and mighty&#8230; I just hope you can keep that attitude after I beat you into the ground and make you call me &#8216;Grandpa&#8217;."</p> <p>As he finished speaking, Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eyes grew dark and deep, like an abyssal ocean trench.</p> <p>He sank into his stance, knees bending slightly.</p> <p>A low, rolling sound, like waves surging and crashing, echoed from within his body.</p> <p>In the blink of an eye, he vanished from sight&#8212;</p> <p>Only to reappear at Chen Ye&#8217;s left!</p> <p>His right palm lashed out from below at an angle, its force howling through the air.</p> <p>A thunderous roar followed, like an enraged sea crashing against the shore.</p> <p>Just hearing it made one feel as though they were standing at the ocean&#8217;s edge.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s gaze flickered.</p> <p>Without moving his body, his left palm floated out to meet the strike.</p> <p>"Clang!"</p> <p>Their palms clashed&#8212;</p> <p>The sharp, ringing sound was like metal striking metal.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun's eyes widened in shock.</p> <p>"Thirteen Grand Guardians&#8217; Iron Body Technique?!"</p> <p>Even as he spoke, his hands did not falter.</p> <p>The moment his right palm was blocked, his left palm struck toward Chen Ye&#8217;s chest.</p> <p>Internal energy surged&#8212;</p> <p>A violent gust howled through the air.</p> <p>The sound of waves crashing against the cliffs grew even more distinct.</p> <p>The passing wind carried the scent of the sea.</p> <p>Above them, a thin cloud drifted across the night sky, obscuring the crescent moon.</p> <p>The street plunged into darkness.</p> <p>The howling palm wind roared closer, an unstoppable tide crashing toward its target.</p> <p>Even the mere sound of it sent shivers down the spine.</p> <p>Yet Chen Ye&#8217;s face remained unchanged.</p> <p>He turned.</p> <p>His right palm swept out&#8212;</p> <p>A light, effortless motion.</p> <p>"Clang!"</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s right palm collided with Nan Yiyun&#8217;s left.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun lightly tapped his foot against the ground and leaped backward, soaring several meters before landing steadily. His expression turned serious as he stared at Chen Ye.</p> <p>"What kind of palm technique was that?"</p> <p>They had exchanged two strikes, yet Chen Ye hadn't even budged.</p> <p>Even more baffling, both of Nan Yiyun&#8217;s Roaring Wave Palms had been effortlessly neutralized.</p> <p>With his years of experience in the martial world, Nan Yiyun prided himself on his keen eye for martial techniques. And yet, he couldn&#8217;t recognize what Chen Ye had just used.</p> <p>"I wasn&#8217;t using a palm technique," Chen Ye replied indifferently.</p> <p>He had never practiced one.</p> <p>All he had done was circulate his Innate Qi, and with his internal energy flowing, his reaction speed had significantly heightened.</p> <p>He had merely relied on instinct and his Indestructible Body to withstand those two strikes.</p> <p>A glimmer of admiration flashed in Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eyes.</p> <p>"Good!" he exclaimed.</p> <p>"To transcend form itself&#8212;no technique, yet overwhelming technique&#8230; Among the younger generation, you&#8217;re the first to reach such a level!"</p> <p>Chen Ye: "&#8230;"</p> <p>He took a deep breath and said evenly, "Go all out. I want to see just how strong a grandmaster really is."</p> <p>With that&#8212;</p> <p>He fully activated the Innate Qi within his body.</p> <p>Pure, warm energy coursed through his meridians along the pathways of his internal art.</p> <p>A formless pressure radiated from him.</p> <p>At that very moment, the thin cloud obscuring the crescent moon drifted away.</p> <p>Once more, the cold moonlight spilled onto the street.</p> <p>Bathed in silver light, Chen Ye stood tall, his expression calm, his gaze fathomless.</p> <p>An invisible aura surrounded him, extending two meters in every direction.</p> <p>Where the moonlight touched him, the air seemed to ripple&#8212;</p> <p>Light itself bended around the force of his inner strength.</p> <p>To any observer, the two-meter radius around Chen Ye was distinctly outlined by this True Qi Barrier.</p> <p>Standing beneath the moon, he seemed almost otherworldly&#8212;like an immortal descended to the mortal realm.</p> <p>His gaze landed on Nan Yiyun, cool and detached.</p> <p>"Make your move," Chen Ye said lightly.</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s eyes widened in shock, his pupils constricting.</p> <p>"A Grandmaster?!"</p> <p>"Impossible!"</p> <p>His voice rose in disbelief.</p> <p>"Aside from those old Daoist bastards in Wudang, there&#8217;s actually another grandmaster?"</p> <p>Suddenly, something clicked in his mind.</p> <p>"You&#8217;re Donghua?"</p> <p>He looked at Chen Ye with grave seriousness.</p> <p>"That&#8217;s right," Chen Ye answered flatly.</p> <p>"Shit&#8230; I miscalculated."</p> <p>Nan Yiyun clenched his teeth, regret flashing across his face.</p> <p>He had agreed to this match&#8212;if he lost, he would have to hand over the Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique.</p> <p>If such a technique fell into the hands of a grandmaster, the implications would be far-reaching.</p> <p>His expression shifted, hardening with resolve.</p> <p>"If you&#8217;re truly a grandmaster, then I won&#8217;t hold back either!"</p> <p>As soon as he spoke, he pursed his lips and took a deep breath.</p> <p>The wind rose.</p> <p>Tree branches trembled.</p> <p>Dust lifted from the ground.</p> <p>The distant barking of dogs in the nearby houses abruptly ceased&#8212;replaced only by low, uneasy whimpers.</p> <p>Chen Ye&#8217;s eyes flickered with surprise.</p> <p>He hadn&#8217;t expected a grandmaster&#8217;s presence to stir the very air itself.</p> <p>But what astonished him even more was that as Nan Yiyun inhaled, Chen Ye could feel the Innate Qi he had released into his surroundings subtly shifting&#8212;almost as if being drawn toward Nan Yiyun.</p> <p>However, his Innate Qi was flawless and complete, without gaps or leaks. It remained untouched, unshaken.</p> <p>"Interesting," Chen Ye murmured, a faint smile playing at his lips.</p> <p>The wind gradually died down.</p> <p>Under the moonlit sky&#8212;</p> <p>Nan Yiyun, dressed in his tattered beggar&#8217;s rags, now exuded an aura of immense authority and depth.</p> <p>"Whoosh, whoosh&#8230;"</p> <p>From within his body came the unmistakable sound of waves surging and crashing.</p> <p>Chen Ye, clad in white, remained composed.</p> <p>He raised his right hand, fingers slightly curled, beckoning Nan Yiyun forward.</p> <p>In the next instant&#8212;</p> <p>"Boom!"</p> <p>A massive wave crashed against the rocks!</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>At the orphanage
</p> <p>The sound of sizzling oil crackled from the kitchen.
</p> <p>Chen Ye held a metal wok in his hands. Inside, fluffy white rice mixed with golden bits of scrambled egg.
</p> <p>With a few swift movements of his spatula, he stirred the ingredients together, ensuring an even blend.
</p> <p>Picking up a nearby plate filled with finely chopped green onions, he tipped them into the wok, letting them mix with the rice and egg.
</p> <p>After a few more tosses, he sprinkled in a pinch of salt.
</p> <p>Slowly, a rich and enticing aroma filled the kitchen.
</p> <p>Seated at the table, Nan Yiyun&#8217;s expression was dark as he inhaled the mouthwatering scent of the fried rice. The corners of his mouth twitched, and he discreetly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.
</p> <p>Before long&#8212;
</p> <p>The egg fried rice was ready.
</p> <p>Chen Ye scooped it into two bowls.
</p> <p>He placed one in front of Nan Yiyun and set the other before himself.
</p> <p>Passing a pair of chopsticks over, he said apologetically, "My apologies, Master Nan."
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun snorted, turning away, his face still stormy with anger.
</p> <p>The entire left side of his face was swollen, with a clear palm print imprinted upon it.
</p> <p>His face was completely unbalanced&#8212;as if he&#8217;d been slapped a dozen times on one side.
</p> <p>Chen Ye felt rather guilty.
</p> <p>During their fight earlier, he had misjudged his strength.
</p> <p>With his body filled with pure Innate Qi, a single slap had sent Nan Yiyun reeling, making the old man see stars.
</p> <p>After exchanging more than ten moves, Nan Yiyun finally gave up, his face dark with frustration.
</p> <p>He simply couldn&#8217;t land a hit.
</p> <p>And when Chen Ye retaliated with a palm strike, the force of his internal energy had shaken Nan Yiyun to his very core, as though his organs were about to shatter.
</p> <p>Only after the fight did Chen Ye realize&#8212;he had actually slapped Nan Yiyun&#8217;s face so hard that it swelled.
</p> <p>When Nan Yiyun touched his own face, he was so furious he nearly fainted.
</p> <p>So, as an apology, Chen Ye had offered to make him a late-night meal.
</p> <p>"Hmph!"
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun eyed the steaming fried rice before him. The golden egg, the crisp green onions, the fluffy white grains&#8212;
</p> <p>His throat bobbed as he swallowed again.
</p> <p>His expression finally softened.
</p> <p>Picking up the chopsticks, he grabbed his bowl and began eating heartily.
</p> <p>The moment the fried rice entered his mouth, his eyes widened.
</p> <p>"Mm!"
</p> <p>A grunt of satisfaction escaped him.
</p> <p>Chen Ye, seeing this, simply smiled and picked up his own bowl.
</p> <p>A short while later&#8212;
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun wiped his greasy mouth with his sleeve and let out a satisfied sigh.
</p> <p>"Now, this is worth living!"
</p> <p>Licking his lips, he suddenly noticed his wine gourd sitting on the kitchen counter.
</p> <p>His face darkened slightly.
</p> <p>Grabbing it, he pulled out the stopper and took a long swig.
</p> <p>The rich fragrance of Shaoxing Yellow wine filled the air as he swallowed. A faint flush crept onto his face.
</p> <p>He let out a small burp and turned to Chen Ye.
</p> <p>"Among grandmasters, we are equals in title," he said. "Brother Dong, though I&#8217;m a few years your senior, would it be acceptable if I called you that?"
</p> <p>Chen Ye smiled. "Brother Nan."
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun had just begun to smile in return&#8212;only for his swollen cheek to pull at the movement.
</p> <p>His expression instantly froze.
</p> <p>"I lost, and I accept my defeat," he said begrudgingly.</p> <p>I&#8217;ll write down the training method and inner cultivation technique for Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique for you."
</p> <p>"But we need to agree&#8212;this is for your eyes only. You must not pass it on."
</p> <p>His expression was serious, though there was a faint bitterness beneath it.
</p> <p>Who would have thought that sneaking out for a meal would lead to him stumbling upon a grandmaster?
</p> <p>And then gambling away his martial arts manual?
</p> <p>If it weren&#8217;t for the fact that Chen Ye was polite, well-mannered, and a damn good cook&#8212;
</p> <p>He would have run away long ago.
</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled. "Brother Nan, you needn&#8217;t worry. I only wish to study it."
</p> <p>"Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique&#8217;s resonance-based energy strikes are quite fascinating."
</p> <p>Hearing this, Nan Yiyun immediately understood what Chen Ye was aiming for.
</p> <p>He frowned slightly. "You&#8217;re thinking of integrating resonance-based strikes?"
</p> <p>Chen Ye nodded lightly.
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun shook his head.
</p> <p>"If you practiced the inner arts of another sect, it might be possible," he explained.
</p> <p>"But you practice daoist methods. The moment you condensed Innate Qi, your body became flawless and without leaks."
</p> <p>"The core of Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique is generating multiple streams of internal energy that resonate with each other."
</p> <p>"But right now, you only have a single, unified stream of Innate Qi. It&#8217;s impossible."
</p> <p>"Unless&#8212;" Nan Yiyun hesitated, then scoffed. "Unless you can cultivate a second stream of Innate Qi. But that&#8217;s impossible."
</p> <p>He finished his analysis with confidence.
</p> <p>Chen Ye simply smiled and didn&#8217;t argue.
</p> <p>His Innate Qi was boundless.
</p> <p>If he wanted to cultivate another stream of energy, it would be effortless.
</p> <p>But if he said that out loud, he would surely give Nan Yiyun a heart attack.
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun took another swig of his wine, looking somewhat melancholic.
</p> <p>"Damn it&#8230; I finally took in a disciple," he muttered. &#8220;And his Foster Father turns out to be a grandmaster too."
</p> <p>Chen Ye chuckled. "I run an orphanage. I raise people&#8212;I don&#8217;t teach martial arts."
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun shot him a glare. "Hmph! Someday, that brat Sun Sheng will think only of his Foster Father and not of his master."
</p> <p>"If he ever masters martial arts, he&#8217;ll be closer to you than to me."
</p> <p>"What the hell is this? Am I your damn babysitter?"
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun wanted to curse out loud but, considering that Chen Ye was also a grandmaster, he swallowed the words.
</p> <p>Instead, he sulked and took another drink.
</p> <p>"Brother Dong, you&#8217;re a strange one," he grumbled. "I thought I was odd, but you&#8217;re even weirder than me."
</p> <p>He studied Chen Ye, clicking his tongue.
</p> <p>"You don&#8217;t look a day over twenty-five. At your age, having already cultivated Innate Qi&#8212;you could start your own sect. Daoist martial arts are sturdy, with long-lasting foundations. They even extend lifespan. With your abilities, you could protect a sect for over a hundred years."
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun took another sip of wine, his throat warming.
</p> <p>"And yet, you&#8217;re here running an orphanage? You&#8217;re truly an odd one."
</p> <p>Chen Ye merely smiled. "Everyone has their own path."
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun nodded. "Fair enough."
</p> <p>"Then I&#8217;ll leave Xiao Sheng in your care," Chen Ye said with a grin.
</p> <p>Nan Yiyun&#8217;s face darkened.
</p> <p>Had he really become a babysitter after all?
</p> <p>"Hmph."
</p> <p>He let out a disgruntled snort, grabbed his wine gourd, and stood up.
</p> <p>Waving a hand dismissively, he said, "I&#8217;m off."
</p> <p>Chen Ye walked him to the orphanage&#8217;s gate.
</p> <p>&#8230; 
</p> <p>The next morning&#8212;
</p> <p>On the wooden kitchen table, he found a complete copy of Thousand Layers, Hundred Waves Technique.</p> <p class="text-m">Enhance your reading experience by removing ads for as low as

                            </p><p>A damp, shadowy underground prison cell.
</p> <p>"Drip&#8230; drip&#8230;"
</p> <p>Water dripped from the ceiling, landing in a broken porcelain bowl.
</p> <p>The brown porcelain bowl, barely the size of half a palm, held a few mouthfuls of water.
</p> <p>The water was murky, carrying a foul smell.
</p> <p>A pair of filthy hands carefully cradled the bowl.
</p> <p>"Second Brother, here&#8212;water&#8230; we have water&#8230;" A hoarse voice broke the silence.
</p> <p>In the cramped, dimly lit cell, a man dressed in white prison garb, his hair hanging in disarray, stumbled forward with the bowl in his hands.
</p> <p>Every step he took made the chains on his body clatter.
</p> <p>A closer look would reveal that his clavicles had been pierced through with iron chains&#8212;thick, refined steel that ran down to his ankles.
</p> <p>This was a form of punishment designed for martial artists of great skill, rendering them powerless once their clavicles were impaled.
</p> <p>Against the damp, icy wall sat another man.
</p> <p>Like the one holding the bowl, he wore a tattered white prison uniform. His face was gaunt, his complexion deathly pale, his hair matted and unkempt.
</p> <p>His clavicles, too, were bound by the same brutal chains.
</p> <p>The staggering man finally reached the wall and brought the porcelain bowl close to the other man's lips.
</p> <p>The man against the wall weakly opened his cracked lips and sipped the murky, foul-smelling water.
</p> <p>After just one sip, he shut his lips tightly.
</p> <p>He shook his head, his voice faint. "Xiao Shun, that&#8217;s enough for me."
</p> <p>The disheveled man holding the bowl let out a raspy chuckle.
</p> <p>"Second Brother, don&#8217;t hold back. Drink. I found another leak. The water that drips in throughout the day&#8212;it's enough for both of us."
</p> <p>The man against the wall managed a small smile, revealing a neat row of teeth.
</p> <p>"Truly?"
</p> <p>"As true as gold!"
</p> <p>The man parted his dry, peeling lips again and drank.
</p> <p>Soon, the water in the bowl was gone.
</p> <p>The man holding the empty bowl smiled.
</p> <p>He staggered back to the spot where the ceiling had been leaking earlier and tilted his head up, staring into the darkness above.
</p> <p>After a while&#8212;
</p> <p>Plop.
</p> <p>A single drop of water fell from above, striking his face.
</p> <p>His smile deepened.
</p> <p>He set the porcelain bowl down and slowly sat beside it.
</p> <p>Then, he raised a hand to his face, touching the spot where the water had landed.
</p> <p>His fingers traced the damp patch gently before slipping into his mouth.
</p> <p>A dry tongue licked his fingertips twice.
</p> <p>The cool sensation made his face relax in brief bliss.
</p> <p>"Drip&#8230; drip&#8230;"
</p> <p>The sound of water dripping echoed intermittently in the cell.
</p> <p>Then, the man against the wall spoke again, his voice barely above a whisper.
</p> <p>"Xiao Shun&#8230; after all this time&#8230;"
</p> <p>"I still don&#8217;t know your real name."
</p> <p>"We're near the end now. Will you tell me?"
</p> <p>The man beside the porcelain bowl chuckled, his voice hoarse.
</p> <p>"Second Brother&#8230;"
</p> <p>"My surname is Sun. My name&#8212;Sheng."
</p> <p>"&#8216;White Stripe in the Waves&#8217;&#8212;Zhang Shun was just a nickname."
</p> <p>The man against the wall smiled upon hearing this.
</p> <p>"Sun Sheng&#8230;"
</p> <p>"A good name."
</p> <p>The man beside the bowl grinned. "I think so too."
</p> <p>Creaaaak&#8230;
</p> <p>The stone door of the underground prison groaned as it shifted open.
</p> <p>A beam of light seeped through the gap.
</p> <p>Hearing the sound, the man beside the bowl suddenly laughed.
</p> <p>"Second Brother, it's time."
</p> <p>The man against the wall let out a rattling breath.
</p> <p>"It is."
</p> <p>"Sheng, do you regret it?"
</p> <p>"Regret? I regret not killing that bastard sooner!"
</p> <p>"Hahahaha&#8230; But what a pity, Sheng. I won&#8217;t get to meet your elder brother. Such a pity&#8230;"
</p> <p>"Second Brother, if you met my elder brother, you&#8217;d be in awe of him too!"
</p> <p>"Hahahaha&#8230;" The man against the wall burst into hoarse laughter.
</p> <p>"Hahahaha&#8230;" The man beside the bowl joined in.
</p> <p>Their laughter echoed through the damp, gloomy cell.
</p> <p>Creaaaak&#8230;
</p> <p>The stone door swung further open.
</p> <p>Torchlight spilled in.
</p> <p>Figures stood silhouetted against the glow.
</p> <p>Through the flickering flames, their garments became faintly visible&#8212;black silk robes embroidered in intricate patterns, golden daggers glinting at their waists. </p> <p>Yuyu: Okay, foreshadowing again.
